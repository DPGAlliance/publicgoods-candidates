In addition, there are other already recognized Digital Public Goods, such as FarmOS(https://www.drupal.org/project/farm), that are built with Drupal as the foundation. \r\n\r\n===========\r\nDirect support:  \r\n===========\r\n\r\n===========\r\n8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTarget 8.2: Diversify, innovate and upgrade for economic productivity\r\nTarget 8.5: Full employment and decent work with equal pay\r\n\r\nBecause Drupal is an innovative and market leading software platform--that is open source and based on common technology standards--provides direct opportunities for economic empowerment. \r\n\r\nAs an open source project with robust multilingual support a global community of contributors, Drupal is available to anyone, without licensing fees, dramatically lowering the start-up cost of digital business for entrepreneurs around the world. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Drupal jobs are tech jobs, not gate-kept traditional degrees or mandatory certifications, and can be done from anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nAs an open source project, Drupal supports entrepreneurs who want to build a new business opportunity on the web. This is reflected in the nearly 1 million websites using Drupal today: https://www.drupal.org/project/usage/drupal \r\n\r\nOn the enterprise scale as well, analysts like Gartner and Forrester see significant economic opportunities in the use of open source softwares: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/what-open-sources-collision-with-paas-means-for-drupal-and-wordpress-services-forr-in-3-video/ \r\n\r\nThere is also an ecosystem of more than a thousand Drupal agencies hiring Drupal talent in nearly every country in the world, and tens of thousands of end-users who need the same talent. Because Drupal is a widely adopted technology in both the private and public sector, Drupal empowers those who learn it with more bargaining power and more opportunities for jobs in Open Source technology. Demand is high enough that the Drupal Association maintains jobs.drupal.org as a platform to connect talented Drupal developers to employment opportunities. \r\nhttps://www.drupal.org/drupal-services \r\nhttps://jobs.drupal.org\r\nhttps://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Drupal+Developer&l=&vjk=c4545e0824ca3195 \r\n\r\nFinally communities all of the world have local associations that connect emerging Drupal talent with economic opportunities in their area: \r\nhttps://www.drupal.org/node/3069614 \r\n\r\n===========\r\n10: Reduced Inequalities\r\n===========\r\n\r\nTarget 10.1: Reduce income inequalities\r\nTarget 10.2: Promote universal social, economic and political inclusion\r\n\r\nOpen source software such as Drupal offers a counter-balance to traditional economic models that extract resources from developing nations rather than providing them resources. An internet based on proprietary technology, patents, and trademarks replicates the wealth extraction of private industry, and crowds out entrepreneurship. It puts the wealth and value in only a few hands.\r\n\r\nIn contrast Drupal and the open web focus on providing a free and open internet, where that economic opportunity is accessible to all. In particular, Drupal empowers low-income users around the globe in two key ways.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship - In the last two decades, entrepreneurs have built businesses based on Drupal all over the world, participating in an ecosystem of almost $4 billion of economic activity.
