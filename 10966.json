    "description": "CodiPlay is a Kazakhstani EdTech startup with gamification elements aimed at teaching children programming. The app of the same name allows them to learn to programme and create gadgets (IoT projects) using games. The startup uses innovative code compilation technology on a smartphone to teach programming languages such as Scratch, Block Coding, C++ and Python. Through designing and building IoT gadgets, students learn the fundamentals and core concepts of robotics.",

In particular, it relates to indicators 4.3 and 4.4, as by teaching programming languages in school, the platform ensures equal access for all to affordable and quality technical education, also contributing to increasing the number of youth with technical skills for employment. It is also relevant to Indicator 5.B because by providing access to information and communication technology education equally to girls and boys from school, it contributes to the empowerment of women, enabling them to take an equal share of a market that has traditionally been dominated by men. We believe that CodiPlay provides the same start for all children and the knowledge we pass on to children is of generational importance."
