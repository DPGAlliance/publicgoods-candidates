# Reporting Bugs in the DPG Submission Form

If you find any errors during submission on the forms available at:

```
* https://submission.digitalpublicgoods.net
* https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission (which redirects to the one above)
```

You can help us fix the error by reporting the bug. 

## Creating an Issue on the appropriate repo

All issues related to the submission form are tracked on the [issues page](https://github.com/dpgabot/submission-digitalpublicgoods/issues/) of the [submission-digitalpublicgoods](https://github.com/dpgabot/submission-digitalpublicgoods/) repository.

On creating a new issue, you should see a bug reporting template available. Please use the template to record the information we need to isolate and fix the bug.

## The Template

### Bug Description
```
Provide a quick description of the bug. For example, “Distorted Text in FAQ section on <name> homepage”.
```

### Steps to Reproduce the Bug
Number the steps clearly from first to last so that the developers can quickly and exactly follow them to see the bug for themselves. For example:
```
1. Click “nominate” on the Homepage (this takes the user to the eligibity page).
2. Click on “Submit now as a DPG Nominee” is disabled.
3. etc.
```

### Expected Result
```
How is the software supposed to work, with regard to the particular area in which the bug appears? The developer needs to know what the requirement is, in order to gauge the extent to which the bug is disrupting the user experience.

Describe the ideal end-user scenario, and try to offer as much detail as possible. Don’t just leave it at “the website is crashing, and it shouldn’t.”
```

### Actual Result
```
Detail what the bug is actually doing, and how it is a distortion of the expected result.

- Elaborate on the issue
- Is the software crashing?
- Is it simply pausing in action?
- Does an error appear?
- Or is it simply unresponsive?

For example:

- “Link does not lead to the expected page. It shows a 404 error.”
- “When clicked, the button does not do anything at all.”
```

### Environment
A bug can appear in a particular environment and not others. For example, a bug appears when running the website on Firefox, or malfunctions only when running on an Windows 11. When reporting the bug, kindly provide the browsers and operating system details as requested below:

```
- What browser did this occur on?
- What operating system did this occur on?
```
