# Overview of the Digital Public Goods ecosystem

1. Start with an introduction of the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are/): who we are, our approach and timeline. The Alliance also co-ordinates activities with other organisations that are working on digital public goods. Some of these organisations are official members of the alliance and others participate in the [collective roadmap](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/roadmap/). The roadmap activities are coordinated keeping in mind the [5-year strategy](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/DPGA_Strategy_2021-2026.pdf#page=13).
2. Read about the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/): nine indicators that define the requirements for a digital solution to become a digital public good. The DPG Standard is itself an open project with an associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard) that details how these nine indicators are further broken down in a [set of questions](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard-questions.md) that are asked of any potential digital public good.
3. An [Eligibility Form](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/) is provided as an easy entry point into the process of becoming a digital public good. Conceived as a self help resource, it guides the owner of a prospective digital public good to quickly assess if their digital solution is likely to meet the DPG Standard or not. This form is coded in React and the [code is open source](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-scripts/tree/main/packages/eligibility).
4. The [Registry of Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) provides an up-to-date list of all the digital solutions that have been reviewed and meet the DPG Standard. The registry also includes a list of **nominees**: those projects that meet indicators 1 and 2 (SDG relevance and open license, respectively) of the DPG Standard, and may become digital public goods in the future.
5. The [DPG Submission Form](https://submission.digitalpublicgoods.net/) provides a user-friendly interface that asks all the necessary information from a digital solution to be considered as a digital public good. It includes all the questions documented in the DPG Standard repository linked above in #2. This form is coded in React using Data Driven Forms and the [code is open source](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-submission).
6. The data from the Registry comes from the [unicef/publicgoods-candidates](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates) code repository, where all the information collected from both [nominees](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/tree/main/nominees) and [digital public goods](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/tree/main/digitalpublicgoods) is encoded in JSON files.
    - [Issues](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues) are created to track progress on groups of prospective digital public goods, for example:
        - [2021 Drone Toolkit Nominations](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/699)
        - [DPGs from UNICEF Ghana StartUp Lab](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/678)
        - [2021 UNICEF Bridge Funding Cohort](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/624)
        - [2021 UNICEF Blockchain Cohort](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/624)
        - [Fintech for Impact DPGs from the Philippines](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/619)
        - [Backlog of Outstanding UNICEF Innovation Fund investees](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/558)
        - [Climate Change Adaptation Community of Practice](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/issues/554)
    - When either a full submission or a nomination is received, a pull request is opened in this repository where the review by DPGA staff can be transparently tracked. Each pull request is labeled as a [nomination](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Anomination) or a [digital public good](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Digital+Public+Good%22) depending on the information provided. The initial triage is currently done by [@nathanbaleeta](https://github.com/nathanbaleeta), with subsequent review and approval by [@conradsp](https://github.com/conradsp) and [@lacabra](https://github.com/lacabra).
7. The [DPG Map](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/map/) visualizes the geographic distribution of digital public goods development and implementations, including elements of storytelling. Data is displayed on a world map using *Mapbox*, and integrated on a React frontend. Storytelling feature realized with *react-scrollama* library. [The code is open source](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-scripts/tree/main/packages/map).
