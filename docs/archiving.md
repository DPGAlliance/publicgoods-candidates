# Archiving Policy

The DPG Registry includes both digital solutions that have been confirmed as digital public goods and those that have been nominated to be digital public goods ("nominees").

To be considered a digital public good, all requirements of the DPG Standard must be met. Once a year, all digital public goods will have their documentation re-reviewed by the DPGA to ensure requirements are still met. Nominees have not yet been reviewed against the DPG Standard, or may currently be undergoing review. Digital solutions that are no longer active, or do not provide the required documentation needed for review, will be removed from the DPG Registry.

Licensing information for all digital solutions is based on information received and collected from project owners, and in some cases has been simplified. Before implementation is considered, licensing information should be reviewed in full by visiting the sources provided to ensure no changes have been made.
