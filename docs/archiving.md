### Spam Policy: 
Any nominations that are deemed nonsensical, malicious, irrelevant or in violation of our Code of Conduct will not be reviewed and will be deleted from the GitHub & Registry. 


### Nominee review policy:  
Anyone can nominate a digital solution to the registry using the public form at digitalpublicgoods.net/nominate/
In order to appear on the DPG Registry as a Nominee - solutions must demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals and use of an approved open license as indicated by indicators 1 & 2 of the DPG Standard. 

### DPG Review Policy: 
Solutions will be assessed against the 9 indicators of the latest version of the DPG Standard at time of nomination. 
The latest version of the DPG standard can be found on the website and on GitHub. 
Questions included in the DPG Nomination form are transparently visible on GitHub here. 
Full submissions require evidence given by someone authorised to speak on behalf of the project. We collect title, name, and contact information to confirm this authority.
Email verification of the “representative” may be conducted
A technical coordinator from the DPGA will reach out to seek clarification, gather information and support projects as they undergo vetting 
The screening process for all DPGs will appear transparently on GitHub here. 
Final determination on whether a solution adheres to the DPG Standard will be made by the DPGA Secretariat’s technical coordinator, in consensus/consultation with the Community Manager, the Product Manager and the domain experts consulting on the case. Consensus building may happen through Slack channel, signal group or in-person meetings
Decisions of the review team are binding and will be transparently displayed on the GitHub PR of each application. The applicant may seek more clarifications on GitHub from the experts directly on Github
Product owners may request updates, seek clarifications or raise disagreements with the assessment through the technical coordinator or by commenting on the process on GitHub at any time
When they are contacted by the technical coordinator to clarify their submission or request additional information, applicants have 30 days to respond.
If after 30 days - applicants either fail to provide the relevant information, are unresponsive or indicate they are unable to meet the requirements of the standard will be moved to “inactive” 

### Annual Review Policy:
After 365 days - DPGs will be asked to re-verify against the DPG Standard and to provide information indicating that they still comply with the indicators. 
The re-review will review the solution against the DPG Standard version that is relevant at the time of the annual review and therefore may require more or additional information than during the original review. 
Once a solution has been contacted for re-verification they will have 30 days to provide the relevant information to align with the most recent version of the DPG Standard. 
After 30 days - solutions that are unable to demonstrate adherence with the standard or are unresponsive will be moved to “inactive” and have an additional 30 days to complete the full process. 

### DPGs on the Registry: 
Solutions that demonstrate adherence to all 9 indicators of the DPG Standard via the DPG Review will appear on the registry as a DPG
Solutions that appear on the registry will be notified that they are DPGs and will be invited to use the DPG term, the DPGA icon to describe the solution and to promote their solution and to link to the DPG Registry. 
All of the information provided during the nomination process, excluding any personal information provided by the submitter, will be publicly accessible and discoverable on the DPG Registry at digitalpublicgoods.net/regsitry/[solutionname].html
All of the information available on the DPG Registry is openly licensed and made accessible to any other entity wishing to display it via an API - as such information on the DPG registry may be mirrored or used by any number of other entities 
DPGs are required to re-verify against the DPG Standard on an annual basis by providing information indicating that they comply with the latest version of the DPG Standard. 
On an ongoing basis DPGs must always be able to demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals and use of an approved open license as indicated by indicators 1 & 2 of the DPG Standard. 
If at any point a DPG is found to no longer use an open license or be relevant to the SDGs they will be removed from the Registry. To report a DPG that may no longer meet this criteria please email support@digitalpublicgoods.net. 

### Inactive Solutions: 
If a submission is designated as “inactive” it will not appear in the Registry but will be accessible in a public list of dormant solutions via a link on the Registry page. 
All of the information in the dormant submissions will be preserved and can be “reactivated” at any point time should the product owner wish to resume the process. 
In order to “reactivate” a dormant solution the product owner should contact the technical coordinator or support@digitalpublicgoods.net. 

### Removing a project from the registry: 
A digital solution will be removed from the registry by the DPGA Secretariat if: 
It is considered spam (see spam policy)
If it found to no longer use an open license or be relevant to the SDGs 
At the request of the original nominator or someone with authority to speak on behalf of the solution. Note that if the individual requesting removal is different from the original nominator we may contact the original nominator.

### Archiving Policy

The DPG Registry includes both digital solutions that have been confirmed as digital public goods and those that have been nominated to be digital public goods ("nominees").

To be considered a digital public good, all requirements of the DPG Standard must be met. Once a year, all digital public goods will have their documentation re-reviewed by the DPGA to ensure requirements are still met. Nominees have not yet been reviewed against the DPG Standard, or may currently be undergoing review. Digital solutions that are no longer active, or do not provide the required documentation needed for review, will be removed from the DPG Registry.

Licensing information for all digital solutions is based on information received and collected from project owners, and in some cases has been simplified. Before implementation is considered, licensing information should be reviewed in full by visiting the sources provided to ensure no changes have been made.
