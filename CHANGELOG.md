### Added
- Added `scripts/migrate-v0.7.0.json` to adjust all existing JSON files to the change introduced in the `nominee-schema.json` described below.

### Changed
- [Breaking changes] Modified the JSON schema to account for SDG evidence. Thus, `SDGs` is not longer an array of enums, but an array of objects, that contains a required `SDGNumber` and an optional `evidenceText` and `evidenceURL`, one of which should be required. This field is not made mandatory retroactively, but will be required in future nominations.
