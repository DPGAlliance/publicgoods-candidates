### DPG Registry Moderation Policy
* The public DPG registry displays all digital solutions that are recognized as DPGs and Nominees.
* Solutions that appear on the registry as DPGs will be notified and invited to use the DPG term, the DPGA icon and the DPG badge to describe the digital solution and to promote their solution and to link to the DPG Registry.
* All of the information available on the DPG Registry is openly licensed and made accessible to any other entity wishing to display it via an API - as such information on the DPG registry may be mirrored or used by any number of other entities.
* On an ongoing basis, DPGs must always be able to demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals and use of an approved open license.
* If at any point a DPG is found to no longer use an open license or be relevant to the SDGs, they will be removed from the DPG Registry. To report a DPG that may no longer meet this criteria please email support@digitalpublicgoods.net.
* A DPG listing can also be removed at the request of the applicant.


### DPG Status Renewal Policy
* DPG status is valid for one year from the date of completion of review.
* To ensure that a DPG continues to be in compliance with the latest DPG Standard, they must submit a Renewal application.
* Renewal applications can be created when 45 days or less are remaining before the expiry of DPG status. Renewal application can also be created after the DPG status has expired.
* Renewal applications must be created & submitted via the DPGA webapp.
* Upon a re-review, if the solution is found to be in compliance with the latest DPG Standard, they will be stay listed on the DPG Registry.

### Spam Policy
* Any application that is deemed nonsensical, malicious, irrelevant or in violation of our Code of Conduct will not be reviewed and will be removed immediately.

### Issue Resolution Policy
* Progress and status of review of an application is transparently visible on their public URL (app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/[ID]) and via the applicant’s dashboard.
* To engage in the public discourse on a submitted application, please interact with us by commenting the relevant PR on this public GitHub repo.
