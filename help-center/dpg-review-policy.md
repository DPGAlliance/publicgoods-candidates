# DPG Review Policy

This document lays out the policies that govern the review process of DPG applications.

### Nomination Policy
* Owners of digital solutions who wish to get their solution recognized as a Digital Public Good (DPG) must nominate their solution by submitting a DPG application (application)
* Application can be created and submitted through the DPGA webapp at [app.digitalpublicgoods.net](app.digitalpublicgoods.net) 
* The set of questions that are asked as part of the application are transparently available [here](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard-questions.md)
* Applications can only be submitted by an authorised representative of the digital solution (the applicant)
* We collect the name & email of the applicant. Email verification is required in order to submit an application
* Each application is assigned a unique application ID
* Content of each submitted application is made publicly available & licensed as such via Unlicense
* The submitted applications can be accessed via their public URLs (URL format: app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/[ID]) as well as via a PR on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates/pulls)

* Each application is assessed against the latest version of the [DPG Standard](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard.md) at time of creating the application
* Application must meet all the requirements of the DPG Standard to become a DPG. If the application fails to meet one or more requirements, they will be declared as "ineligible to be recognized as a DPG at this time."
* Every review results in a binary decision : DPG or Ineligible
* Final determination on whether a solution adheres to the DPG Standard will be made by the DPGA Secretariat’s Technical Coordinator
* A digital solution recognized as a DPG will be listed on the public [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) and their listing will also made be available to other databases via an API

### DPG Registry Moderation Policy
* The public [DPG registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) displays all digital solutions that are recognized as DPGs and Nominees
* Solutions that appear on the registry as DPGs will be notified and invited to use the DPG term, the DPGA icon and the DPG badge to describe the digital solution and to promote their solution and to link to the DPG Registry
* All of the information available on the DPG Registry is openly licensed and made accessible to any other entity wishing to display it via an API - as such information on the DPG registry may be mirrored or used by any number of other entities
* On an ongoing basis, DPGs must always be able to demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals and use of an approved open license
* If at any point a DPG is found to no longer use an open license or be relevant to the SDGs, they will be removed from the DPG Registry. To report a DPG that may no longer meet this criteria please email support@digitalpublicgoods.net
* A DPG listing can also be removed at the request of the applicant


### DPG Status Renewal Policy
* DPG status is valid for one year from the date of completion of review
* To ensure that a DPG continues to be in compliance with the latest DPG Standard, they must submit a Renewal application
* Renewal applications can be created when 45 days or less are remaining before the expiry of DPG status. Renewal application can also be created after the DPG status has expired
* Renewal applications must be created & submitted via the DPGA webapp
* Upon a re-review, if the solution is found to be in compliance with the latest DPG Standard, they will be stay listed on the DPG Registry

### Spam Policy
* Any application that is deemed nonsensical, malicious, irrelevant or in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will not be reviewed and will be removed immediately

### DPG Status Removal Policy 

* DPGA invites the community members to scrutinize the documentation submitted by DPG owners in order to validate their status as a DPG
* The review team will deliberate on the issues raised and do either of the following 3 things: 
  1. Accept the reservations noted by community and reach out to the DPG owner over email to seek clarification 
  2. Reject the reservations noted by community and stick to the decision on validation a DPG status 
  3. Convene a meeting with the stakeholder that has raised concerns to get more detailed explanation or additional information 
* Please note that the final decision for DPG status validation does rest with the DPG review team 
	The process for community members to engage with DPG review team: 
  ### The process for community members to engage with DPG review team: 
* Status of review of an application is transparently visible on their public URL (app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/[ID])
* To engage in the public discourse on a submitted application, please interact with us by commenting the relevant PR on [this public GitHub repo](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates/pulls)
* The comment should answer “ Why does a certain DPG doesn’t meet the DPG standard criteria?”
* Alternately, to raise disagreements with a review decision or any other issues related to reviews, please write to us at support@digitalpublicgoods.net
