<h1> FAQs for applicants </h1> 

<h2> General Information </h2>


<h4> What is a DPG? </h4>

Digital public goods are open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

This definition is operationalised through the DPG Standard, a set of nine indicators that is used to determine whether a solution is a digital public good. Once a solution is recognised as a digital public good it is discoverable on the DPG Registry.


<h4> What is the process of becoming a DPG? </h4>

You can nominate your submission to become a DPG by filling out the application form found on the DPGA Webapp. All applications are reviewed against the DPG Standard - a set of 9 indicators that form the minimum requirements all solutions should meet in order to be called a digital public good. 

Each application is reviewed by two individual reviewers. The application may also be sent to external experts for their inputs on particular indicators. In case further clarifications are required from the applicants side, the review team will get in touch with you through the Web app itself. 

Once the application completes the process of assessment, it will either be marked as a ‘DPG’ (if it passes all indicators) or as ‘Ineligible’ (if it fails one or more indicators). 
 

<h4> What is the benefit of becoming a DPG? </h4>

Being recognised as a digital public good is increasingly beneficial as the concept of digital public goods gains awareness and traction, including: 

Increasing discoverability and promotion of the digital solution: The DPG registry is shared with a broad audience of stakeholders including governments, NGOs, and the private sector. Content from the registry is also fed into other partner catalogues. 

Deployment opportunities: Relevant digital solutions are showcased to high level stakeholders for particular focus areas. 

Connecting with a global community: DPG owners have regular meetups and conferences to share knowledge, leverage networks and hasten development. 



<h4> How do I know if I am eligible to become a DPG?</h4>

To check the eligibility of a digital solution to become a DPG, you can take our quick 5 minute Eligibility test. This will help you assess the readiness of your solution. 


<h2> Process Assistance</h2>


<h4> Where can I find resources to help me build my application?</h4>

The first guide you can refer to is the Submission guide, it contains an overview of all the information you will need to put together your application. There is also a Github repository which contains more nuanced information regarding different types of applications and questions. The most comprehensive guide to filling out the application can be found at the Help Centre. 


<h4> I need specific information - how can I reach out to you? </h4>

If after going through all available resources, you have further questions or need any assistance, please reach out to us at support@digitalpublicgoods.net


<h4> I was asked for clarifications, how can I submit them? </h4>

You can submit the clarifications asked for through the Web app itself. Please log into your account and click on your application. The indicators where clarifications are asked for will be marked with a yellow dot on the side. You can click on those indicators, enter your clarifications in the text box, and then press submit. 

Please ensure that you provide all clarifications in a clear and concise manner - we depend on self-reporting by all applicants and discourage repeated rounds of clarifications with our review team to optimise on time. In case the clarifications submitted are not self-explanatory and complete, the digital solution will be marked as ‘Ineligible’. 


<h4>I submitted clarifications asked for; then I was asked for further clarifications. What should I do? </h4>

In rare cases, a reviewer might ask applicants to submit a second round of clarifications. You will be notified of this through email. The process of submitting clarifications is the same as listed in point 3. 

Please ensure that you understand the requirements being asked of you and submit them accordingly. If you have any questions regarding what is needed, please reach out to the review team on DPG Review Team before submitting the second round of clarifications. 


<h4>The status on my application says ‘Under Consultation’ - what does that mean? </h4>

Sometimes the review team needs further insights on a particular indicator and the information provided by an applicant. In these cases, they pass on the application further to an external expert reviewer for their input. 

During this time, the status of the application shows as ‘Under Consultation’. 

Once the expert has reviewed the application and submitted their feedback, it is reviewed again by the DPGA review team and a decision is reached. You will be notified of the final decision via email. 


<h4> I have already submitted my application and now I need to update my information. How can I do this? </h4>

If you need to update the information on your application once it has already been listed as a DPG - if for example, the links to its documentation become more robust, or it is adopted by more countries - you can write to us at DPG Review Team and we will update the information on the Registry. 

Please note that if the change includes modifications which affect its open source capabilities, the application will have to be reassessed to ensure that it still meets the requirements. 

If an application previously marked as ‘Ineligible’ has now updated their documentation and / or processes, it will have to re-submit a new application for it. The old version of the application cannot be revived. 

Applications currently under review cannot be modified. Please verify all the information before submitting it. 


<h2>Decisions</h2>


<h4>Who makes the decisions regarding applications? </h4>

All applications are reviewed by two individual reviewers. Sometimes, they loop in an external expert for their inputs. All decisions are final and jointly held by the DPGA Secretariat. 


<h4>How long does the decision making take? </h4>

We try to process applications as quickly as possible. The exact timelines depend on a variety of factors such as whether: 

Clarifications are required by the applicants 

The application has to be forwarded to an expert 

There is a larger initiative such as the Nobel Peace Prize qualifications list, which has resulted in a mass influx of applications at the same time 

In rare cases, the standard is about to undergo a massive change so reviews have been temporarily paused

As such, we cannot provide a specific timeline, but be rest assured that all applicants will be speedily processed while allowing them time to be fairly evaluated. 


<h4>How long is the DPG status valid for? What happens after that? </h4>

The DPG status is valid for a period of one year from its approval. This is to ensure that all solutions comply with the latest <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/">Standard</a> set out by the DPGA. 

All applications undergo an automatic review process at the end of the year. In case certain parameters have changed or further clarifications are needed, the review team will reach out to you over email to provide those. 

In case the solution fails to meet the new standards even after your response, or there is no response from your side, the solution will be marked as ‘Expired’ and be removed from the Registry.


<h4>What happens if my application fails? </h4>

If an application fails one or more indicators, it will be marked as ‘Ineligible’. In case you have queries as to why your solution failed and what you can do, please reach out to the  DPG Review Team and we will be happy to provide more details. 

Don’t be disheartened: Once the suggested changes have been implemented into your solution, you can always reapply to become a DPG!  


<h4>What if I don’t agree with the decision? </h4>

All decisions are taken after careful consideration and multiple rounds of evaluation. The decision making process is publicly documented and can be assessed through your dashboard on the DPGA Webapp. 

If your solution is not accepted, we would recommend updating your documentation or processes as suggested by the review team as then reapplying. 

All decisions are final and non-negotiable. 

However, if you still have queries or believe that your solution was erroneously judged, please reach out to us at DPG Review Team


<h4>What happens if I notice a difference between the standard applied to two applications of a similar nature? </h4>

All applications are evaluated against the same Standard. However, the Standard is an evolving open source project. This means that the criteria to become a DPG may change slightly from time to time. So applications evaluated at a certain time may have been passed, but a new application evaluated against some new or additional criteria may not be. 

However, all applications undergo a yearly review to bring them all up to the latest version of the standard and those that don’t pass are removed from the system.
