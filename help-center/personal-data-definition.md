## Definition for personal data 

It is laid out in the ["Guidance note on big data for achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda"](https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/UNDG_BigData_final_web.pdf)

It reads: 
For the purposes of this document, personal data means data, in any form or medium, relating to an identified or identifiable individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used, including where an individual can be identified by linking the data to other information reasonably available. Personal data is defined by many regional and national instruments and can also be referenced as personal information or personally identifiable information.
