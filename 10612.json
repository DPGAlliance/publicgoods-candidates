        "relevance": "Rahat has been supporting vulnerable communities affected by natural disasters (Target 1.5) through cash and voucher assistance programs, promoting financial resilience and empowering individuals to make their own recovery decisions.\r\n\r\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Rahat efficiently distributed food supplies to vulnerable communities, prioritizing those with small children, single women, and the elderly. Working with Dhana Yoga Foundation, Rahat provided food packets to marginalized communities in Chitwan who lacked sufficient harvests. This initiative contributes to Target 2.1 of ending hunger and ensuring year-round access to nutritious food.\r\n\r\nRahat has been collaborating with local partners to support women's maternity needs by providing nutritious food packages in remote mountainous regions like Humla and Jumla. The ongoing efforts aim to reduce child mortality and promote child development (Target 2.2).\r\n\r\nThe active involvement of local female partners in Rahat's pilot projects enhances digital literacy and familiarity with mobile phone usage (Target 5.b).\r\n\r\nAs a cash and voucher assistance system, Rahat utilizes local traders and institutions to distribute relief packages during disaster recovery. This approach enables local businesses to continue supplying products and generating income, alleviating economic burdens on impoverished individuals and stimulating the local economy."
