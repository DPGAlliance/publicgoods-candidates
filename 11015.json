        "relevance": "SDG4: OpenMandriva Lx is easy to use, and has successfully been used by children. It also has a number of educational packages for many different subjects as well as e-book readers, multimedia players, browsers etc. that can be used to access educational content, both at home and in school.\r\n\r\nSDG9: OpenMandriva Lx provides an innovative OS and related infrastructure that others can build on. By design, others in the industry can take OpenMandriva Lx, make modifications, and release their own product based on it.\r\n\r\nSDG10: By providing a completely free operating system that can run on old hardware (such as 15-years old computers that have been thrown out in a wealthy country/company) as well as cheap new hardware (such as ARM development boards), OpenMandriva Lx enables people who can not afford a brand new computer and a Microsoft or Apple license to get on equal (if not better) footing.\r\n\r\nSDG12: By supporting much lower end hardware than competing closed-source solutions, such as old computers or ARM boards, OpenMandriva Lx enables people to stick with the hardware they have for a long time, allowing responsible (lower) consumption and production compared to proprietary solutions that almost require their users to get a new computer every couple of years."
