  "description": "EPANET is an industry-standard program for modeling the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water distribution system pipe networks. The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is a library of functions (or API) written in C that allow programmers to customize the use of EPANET's solution engine for their own applications.",

      "evidenceText": "EPANET is a software application used throughout the world to model water distribution systems. It was developed as a tool for understanding the movement and fate of drinking water constituents within distribution systems, and can be used for many different types of applications in distribution systems analysis. Today, engineers and consultants use EPANET to design and size new water infrastructure, retrofit existing aging infrastructure, optimize operations of tanks and pumps, reduce energy usage, investigate water quality problems, and prepare for emergencies. It can also be used to model contamination threats and evaluate resilience to security threats or natural disasters.",
