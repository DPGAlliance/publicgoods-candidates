  "description": "The Pasteur Institute, Greater Paris University Hospitals, and the chatbot start-up Clevy created a questionnaire that individuals can use to assess their risk of COVID-19 infection. The form has 23 questions on possible symptoms, medical history, age, and other physical attributes. If a user is deemed a high risk from their responses, they are redirected to emergency services while a suspect case is redirected to telemedicine services.",
