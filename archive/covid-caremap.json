  "description": "Covid Care Map helps with mapping existing and forecasted health system capacity gaps (beds, staffing, ventilators, supplies) to care for surging numbers of COVID-19 patients (especially those requiring intensive care) with granular detail. It organizes data for other apps such as COVID Act Now, which has worked with public health authorities at the state and municipal level to project facility bed estimates.",
