      "evidenceText": "Cities in Latin America and the Caribbean grow spatially and socially segregated. This inequality reflects a widespread need for better living conditions. The problem has been traditionally addressed as a quantity deficit, but it has become a quality deficit: wide swaths of the population lack access to public services, housing tenure and other qualitative aspects. Our tool identifies and monitors location and growth patterns of informal settlements through satellite or aerial images. It can help predict the location and number of residents without access to basic services, and produce extremely-high resolution maps to guide precise targeting of amelioration efforts.",

The solution is able to scale economically and quickly, enabling use at the regional and local levels. This solution is replicable for every country that suffers climate change consequences regarding water hazards.",
