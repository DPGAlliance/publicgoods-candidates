  "description": "The elimu.ai software is a platform of educational content and Android apps. The software is designed in such a way that the children can learn fully autonomously, without guidance from qualified teachers. Instead, an AI tutor (Nya) guides each child through the necessary steps. The AI tutor gradually unlocks more advanced content, as the child demonstrates mastery of prerequisite skills.",
