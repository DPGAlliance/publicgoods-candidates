One of the most common use cases of the resulting API is for government agencies and NGOs to deploy simulators enabling citizens to assess which benefits they are entitled to, allowing them to obtain the social support they should get but too often don't because of lack of information and actionability.\r\n\tExamples: https://www.mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr (France), https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/rac-legal-eligibility/ (New Zealand), https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/lesmevesajudes/ (Spain).\r\n\tImpact assessment in France: https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/general/2019/11/18/mes-aides-metriques/ ; https://blog.beta.gouv.fr/dinsic/2017/05/03/mes-aides-datascience-public/.\r\n\tOpenFisca also improves personal finance and budgeting ability, by enabling any service provider or assistant to compute personal financial obligations and entitlements and predict their evolution across potential life events.\r\n\tExamples: https://www.fastoche.fr/ ; https://pa-comp.firebaseapp.com/ ; https://betagouv.github.io/mes-aides-changent/graphique/?source=/mes-aides-changent/static/celibataire_handicap.json\r\n- 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth\r\n\tBy making social and fiscal legislation executable, OpenFisca empowers individuals and businesses to assess their best employment opportunities, by removing the guesswork in computing exact income after tax and total cost to employer.\r\n\tExamples: https://www.simucrea.fr.\r\n- 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure\r\n\tAPIs based on OpenFisca can model many types of legislation, including niche ones, enabling lawmakers, regulators and businesses to share a common view of their entitlements and duties, and to discuss potential evolutions.\r\n\tExamples: Mining taxes in France are modelled in https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france-fiscalite-miniere ; the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is modelled in https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code, and its National Building Code is being prototyped in a similar fashion.\r\n- 10: Reduced Inequalities (within and between countries)\r\n\tOpenFisca supports citizens in assessing their benefits, thus improving access to social safety nets designed for reducing inequalities (cf. SDG1).\r\n\tBeyond that aspect, by consolidating historical legislative data and enabling large-scale, population-wide simulations, OpenFisca enable economists, researchers, NGOs and lawmakers to assess the impact of existing schemes and potential reforms, improving the understanding of policies impact on inequality and accelerating delivery of policies to reduce it effectively.\r\n\tExamples: The French Institut des Politiques Publiques measured the impact of 5 years of consolidated fiscal reforms on wealth distribution, and was able to reach that level of precision thanks to OpenFisca: https://www.ipp.eu/en/publication/february-2020-budget-2020-what-effects-on-households/ ; https://budget.ipp.eu\r\n\tWith growing OpenFisca adoption, cross-country comparison of implementations of similar policies becomes possible: with a simple mapping of the name of each policy in their respective OpenFisca model, researchers can run simulations over multiple years and populations and compare the results of each policy, enabling identification of the most effective ones.\r\n\tThe World Bank and an upcoming European Union-funded Multi-Country Project also consider modelling international business rules and taxation, enabling identification and correction of policies that place undue burden on individuals and businesses operating across countries.\r\n- 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\r\n\tOpenFisca makes social and fiscal legislation executable (see SDG1). Its technical architecture is designed to allow local governments to complete national regulations with their specific rules, empowering regions, cities and communities to build and improve their own schemes towards inclusion while taking into account the existing laws in which they operate.\r\n\tExamples: the cities of Paris and Brest use OpenFisca to deliver personalised information to residents on their entitlement to local benefits, including mobility and childcare support; Strasbourg used OpenFisca to design the reform of its school canteen scheme, enabling more pupils to access good food at a fair price.\r\n\tOpenFisca can also enable public bodies whose budget is determined based on computable rules to calculate it autonomously, and make it publicly auditable.\r\n\tExamples: the French local governments budgets provided by the State are usually calculated in the second quarter each year, while data to calculate their allotment is available at the beginning of the year, resulting in unnecessary delays for local decision makers. The app \u201cDotations Locales\u201d enables cities and residents to calculate that budget earlier and plan accordingly: https://leximpact.an.fr/dotations.\r\n- 13: Climate Action\r\n\tOpenFisca enables modelling any sort of legislation that contains a computational part. Carbon emission quotas could thus be modelled, improving their understandability and actionability. Just like with budgetary reforms (see SDG10), assessing the impact of climate-related legislation and ways to make it more effective would be significantly easier, cheaper, and more complete with the consolidated models that take into account interaction with other parts of law, like what OpenFisca delivers.\r\n\tExamples: French benefits for improved housing insulation are made more discoverable to citizens, and the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is modelled in https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code.\r\n- 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\r\n\tIn most democratic countries, the executive branch has both ability to propose legislation and is uniquely equipped to assess its impact through direct access to the administration, putting the legislative branch in a situation where it hardly has the resources to double-check effectively the impact assessments, or to properly assess the impact of its own legislation proposals. The exact same asymmetry prevents many civil society proposals for reforms to reach democratic arenas. The models provided by OpenFisca enable lawmakers and NGOs to discuss and design potential reforms on an objective basis, at a very low cost and with high accuracy, and to provide citizens with replicable, auditable assessments.\r\n\tExamples: the French Parliament (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) provides all Members of Parliament with LexImpact, a tool designed for reform assessment; it also has a public instance enabling any citizen to design their own reforms: https://leximpact.an.fr ; PolicyEngine enables reform design for both UK and US legislation: https://policyengine.org/.\r\n\tSee also SDG11 for local institutions strengthening.\r\n- 17: Partnerships for the Goals\r\n\tBeyond technical aspects, OpenFisca\u2019s specificity in the field of rules engine is its deeply collaborative nature. It is a digital common: both the core engine and the country models are created by a multitude of contributors. The rules and tooling that have progressively emerged to support such collaboration and its growth both enable and depend on active contributions by all actors: public administrations who are in charge of a specific aspect of legislation or regulation, researchers who can add historical depth to the data and analyse the resulting models, civil society who can audit and leverage the calculations; all of this in several countries, leading to a more robust shared core set of tools. This open-source, commons-based approach is enforced with reciprocity licenses and usage charters, and pushes all these actors to create new alliances and collaboration approaches based on shared goals that are embodied in a piece of software available to everyone."

SDG1).\r\n\tBeyond that aspect, by consolidating historical legislative data and enabling large-scale, population-wide simulations, OpenFisca enable economists, researchers, NGOs and lawmakers to assess the impact of existing schemes and potential reforms, improving the understanding of policies impact on inequality and accelerating delivery of policies to reduce it effectively.\r\n\tExamples: The French Institut des Politiques Publiques measured the impact of 5 years of consolidated fiscal reforms on wealth distribution, and was able to reach that level of precision thanks to OpenFisca: https://www.ipp.eu/en/publication/february-2020-budget-2020-what-effects-on-households/ ; https://budget.ipp.eu\r\n\tWith growing OpenFisca adoption, cross-country comparison of implementations of similar policies becomes possible: with a simple mapping of the name of each policy in their respective OpenFisca model, researchers can run simulations over multiple years and populations and compare the results of each policy, enabling identification of the most effective ones.\r\n\tThe World Bank and an upcoming European Union-funded Multi-Country Project also consider modelling international business rules and taxation, enabling identification and correction of policies that place undue burden on individuals and businesses operating across countries.\r\n- 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities\r\n\tOpenFisca makes social and fiscal legislation executable (see SDG1). Its technical architecture is designed to allow local governments to complete national regulations with their specific rules, empowering regions, cities and communities to build and improve their own schemes towards inclusion while taking into account the existing laws in which they operate.\r\n\tExamples: the cities of Paris and Brest use OpenFisca to deliver personalised information to residents on their entitlement to local benefits, including mobility and childcare support; Strasbourg used OpenFisca to design the reform of its school canteen scheme, enabling more pupils to access good food at a fair price.\r\n\tOpenFisca can also enable public bodies whose budget is determined based on computable rules to calculate it autonomously, and make it publicly auditable.\r\n\tExamples: the French local governments budgets provided by the State are usually calculated in the second quarter each year, while data to calculate their allotment is available at the beginning of the year, resulting in unnecessary delays for local decision makers. The app \u201cDotations Locales\u201d enables cities and residents to calculate that budget earlier and plan accordingly: https://leximpact.an.fr/dotations.\r\n- 13: Climate Action\r\n\tOpenFisca enables modelling any sort of legislation that contains a computational part. Carbon emission quotas could thus be modelled, improving their understandability and actionability. Just like with budgetary reforms (see SDG10), assessing the impact of climate-related legislation and ways to make it more effective would be significantly easier, cheaper, and more complete with the consolidated models that take into account interaction with other parts of law, like what OpenFisca delivers.\r\n\tExamples: French benefits for improved housing insulation are made more discoverable to citizens, and the Australian Energy Saving Scheme is modelled in https://www.codeforaustralia.org/case-studies/dpie-rules-as-code.\r\n- 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\r\n\tIn most democratic countries, the executive branch has both ability to propose legislation and is uniquely equipped to assess its impact through direct access to the administration, putting the legislative branch in a situation where it hardly has the resources to double-check effectively the impact assessments, or to properly assess the impact of its own legislation proposals. The exact same asymmetry prevents many civil society proposals for reforms to reach democratic arenas. The models provided by OpenFisca enable lawmakers and NGOs to discuss and design potential reforms on an objective basis, at a very low cost and with high accuracy, and to provide citizens with replicable, auditable assessments.\r\n\tExamples: the French Parliament (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) provides all Members of Parliament with LexImpact, a tool designed for reform assessment; it also has a public instance enabling any citizen to design their own reforms: https://leximpact.an.fr ; PolicyEngine enables reform design for both UK and US legislation: https://policyengine.org/.\r\n\tSee also SDG11 for local institutions strengthening.\r\n- 17: Partnerships for the Goals\r\n\tBeyond technical aspects, OpenFisca\u2019s specificity in the field of rules engine is its deeply collaborative nature. It is a digital common: both the core engine and the country models are created by a multitude of contributors. The rules and tooling that have progressively emerged to support such collaboration and its growth both enable and depend on active contributions by all actors: public administrations who are in charge of a specific aspect of legislation or regulation, researchers who can add historical depth to the data and analyse the resulting models, civil society who can audit and leverage the calculations; all of this in several countries, leading to a more robust shared core set of tools. This open-source, commons-based approach is enforced with reciprocity licenses and usage charters, and pushes all these actors to create new alliances and collaboration approaches based on shared goals that are embodied in a piece of software available to everyone."
