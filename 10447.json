        "relevance": "The specific targets would be:\r\n\r\nTarget 3.4: Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health\r\nStudies show that victims of hate speech online may show low self-esteem; feel lonely or isolated, suffer from sleeping disorders, increased anxiety and feelings of fear and insecurity. (source: SELMA - Hacking Online Hate: Building an Evidence Base for Educators - 2019)\r\nGiven that we are a mental, social and emotional wellbeing solution, we are contributing to target 3.4 (reducing mortality from non-communicable diseases and promoting mental health). Even though the indicator is just Suicide rate, we offer preventive and accessible strategies to address the impact that hate speech has in victims and bystanders on their mental health which could lead to potential feelings associated with suicide and suicidal thoughts. We provide coping mechanisms to deal with a violent situation and also prevent it from happening in the future.\r\n\r\nTarget 10.2: Promote universal social, economic and political inclusion\r\nOur Chat Story as well as the relatable examples within the Interventions address different topic that minorities are exposed to with the intention of raising awareness and creating empathy to support them in the future. We care about inclusion, that is why our solution is created a modular story that can fit new audience struggles and examples. We will continue working to diversify the content and the excluded groups will be represented.\r\n\r\nTarget 17.6: Knowledge sharing and cooperation for access to science, technology and innovation\r\nTarget 17.17: Encourage effective partnerships\r\nWe work collectively summoning a co-creation committee composed by topic experts, psychologist, scriptwriters and youth, as well as expert organizations and international organizations such as Unicef.

We wrote the Community Conflict Resolution as follows:\r\n\r\nAs Community Leaders we are responsible for resolving conflicts that may happen within our community of contributors. This is a guideline on how to approach those unpleasant situations as quickly and effective as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnforcement Ladder\r\n\r\nAs part of the Community Impact Guidelines we have set 4 different levels of consequences available to enforce. Logically, it would be a ladder in which the continuous misbehavior will lead to a level 4 consequence. However, some behaviors may apply directly to a level 4 depending on the gravity of the violation.\r\n\r\nThis is a guideline on what would be considered violations of the Code of Conduct and how these will be handled:\r\n\r\nLevel 1 - Correction\r\n\r\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\r\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\r\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\r\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\r\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\r\n\r\nLevel 2 - Warning\r\n\r\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of\r\nactions.\r\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\r\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\r\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\r\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\r\n\r\nLevel 3 - Temporary Ban\r\n\r\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including\r\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\r\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\r\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\r\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\r\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\r\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nLevel 4 - Permanent Ban\r\n\r\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\r\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\r\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\r\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting and Conflict resolution process\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways to receive reports:\r\n\r\n               a. External Reports: A person from our contributors' community sends an email to\r\n               codeofconduct@talk2u.co \r\n               b. Internal Reports: A team member reports the incident via our private slack channel   \r\n               report-misconducts\r\n\r\nAll reports should include: \r\n\r\nA detailed description of what happened, where it happened and when it happened\r\nAny evidence of the misconduct to be reported (screenshots, audio, images, etc). Anything that will allow Community Leader to be quick and effective in the conflict resolution\r\nName of the rule breaker and, if you have it, contact information.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo follow up on reports, we will create and maintain a Code of Conduct Violations Report (CoCVR) document where we will be compiling all the reports of Code of Conduct violation to help us detect recurrent misbehaviors in consequence enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nResolution Process\r\n\r\nSTEP 1 - We receive a misconduct report and assign who will be the community leader that will address the report.\r\n                    \r\nSTEP 2 - We open the CoCVR and we add the information to the spreadsheet. We do a brief analysis and in case we need more information we connect with the reporter and specify what else would be useful for the conflict resolution.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3 - We assess the rule breaker Community status, to do so we take 2 things in consideration:\r\n                    a. Amount of violations they have committed to date within our Community: we search for \r\n                    the rule breaker's name in the CoCVR\r\n                    b. The gravity of the violation: [ADD EXAMPLES OF EXTREME/SERIOUS VIOLATIONS]\r\n\r\nSTEP 4 - We send a response within 72hs of receiving the report to the reporter of the incident informing the next steps to be taken based on the assessment.\r\n\r\nSTEP 5 - We engage with the rule breaker to inform that a report has been received and what has been our decision. This decision might include requesting for more information on their end to comprehend what happened, or it could directly be enforcing one of the levels of our enforcement ladder.\r\n\r\nSTEP 6 - If it is still visible within our Community, we edit, remove or modify the interaction that created the conflict. We might decide to leave it visible and make a public comment regarding our approach towards that behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditional Considerations:\r\n\r\nBi-monthly reports should be delivered to understand our community overall behavior\r\nConflict resolution time tracking should be a must to assess if we are complying with our SLA\r\n\r\nResponsible Community Leaders\r\n\r\nBruna Gelangauskas\r\nLu Su\u00e1rez Batt\u00e1n\r\nNicol\u00e1s Ferrario"

We also go through 3 user testings before launching a pilot",
        " in this case",
        " we reached 144 users testers and 382 pilot participants.\r\n\r\nb. Understand the Existing Ecosystem: we had 11 interviews with experts on the youth and online safety to understand the context (8 of them from Brazil). When including users",

Design for scale: our interventions can be scaled up to any communities since they are hosted in mainstream chat platforms that allows to expand reach based on the penetration of cellphones. We are having conversation with telcos and government to expand our reach through their networks and with additional funding for dissemination after pilot results.\r\n\r\nd.

        " some of the have including in the past",
        " focus groups meetings for a script reading to get feeling and thoughts before building the tech solution. We also use a bot building tool that allows us to build a quick prototype and iterate as many times as needed with minimum effort. This platform also allows us to AB test."
