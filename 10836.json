        "relevance": "MentorED is an open source mentoring application that facilitates lifelong learning and continuous professional development by enabling discovery of trusted mentors and mechanisms. National Education Policy 2020 in India proposes mentoring as a solution at various levels to improve the quality of outcomes. \r\nThe National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) proposes a nationwide mission to incorporate mentoring to improve the acquisition and sharing of knowledge, skills, and mindsets across the Indian education system.\r\nTeachers and School Heads need new solutions to today\u2019s unprecedented demands and challenges. The community of educators and leaders in education in itself is rich with experts, who have the knowledge and skills to contribute towards problem-solving and capacity building of peers. Systems capable of adapting to the rapidly changing environment can empower their citizens with the right mix of skills to allow them to lead satisfying professional and personal lives. This leads to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. \r\nA structure of mentoring, therefore, offers a solution to address the existing gaps in a more decentralised manner. These are the gaps in accessing expertise, continuous professional development, connecting with peers from similar contexts and the absence of a platform to leverage cross-learning. MentorED will be leveraged to implement this nationwide mentoring mission for various outcomes of public education in India.\r\nMentorED, which is also an open-source NDEAR Compliant modular building block, is designed for scale and reliability. \r\nMentoringBlueBook - https://ncte.gov.in/WebAdminFiles/PublicNotice/English_0_04_11_2021_637716090580188670.pdf\r\n\r\nGood Health and Well Being : MentorED is an open source application that can be adopted in the health sector for using the application to increase knowledge among providers and hence provide better health and good well being for people. This is inspired by ECHO model- https://hsc.unm.edu/echo/what-we-do/about-the-echo-model.html. \r\n\r\nReduced Inequalities :\r\nMentorED is an open source application which provides an opportunity to leverage cross learning amongst different individuals leading to their continuous professional development. It makes mentoring accessible to any individual who needs it, regardless of age, background or ethnicities. Several programs will be conceptualised for grassroots inequity by nonprofits and government institutions.\r\n\r\n"
