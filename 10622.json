If you lack diapers you are unable to put your children in daycare, if you can't put your children in daycare you are unable to work, and the situation is exasperated. ,\r\n \r\nEssential banks supply period products to those that wouldn't otherwise be able to afford them. Aside from the human diginity aspect, the lack of period supplies puts those who need them in the situation where they use products longer than intended or use other unsanitary and unsafe methods such as socks, pieces of clothing, and so on."
