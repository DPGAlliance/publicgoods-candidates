Educational content can also be shared in a discrete fashion to ensure that risks of transmission are known. This educational content can be important for many HIV patient groups such as adolescents, MSM, HIV-infected pregnant women to help prevent transmission to sexual contacts and or to unborn babies.\r\nSDG 3.3.2: For TB patients adherence to medication for longer treatment periods is critical to achieve cure. Messages from Connect For Life can take the form of engaging, actionable instructions to help motivate individuals to adhere to therapy and thereby help them to reach care and preventing further transmission.\r\n"
