It also covers extended technical topics related to DHIS2 systems such as server configuration and custom application development, and includes a capacity building section that provides adaptable guides for conducting DHIS2 training courses. Additionally, thorough documentation is provided on the DHIS2 Health Toolkits, which are produced in collaboration with the WHO to support the use of DHIS2 in priority health areas, including design guides that include documentation of data sets and indicators.\r\n\r\nThe DHIS2 documentation is maintained by the core DHIS2 team at the HISP Centre, but external members of the community can submit edits and updates to the documentation via GitHub. The HISP Centre supports translation of the documentation into priority languages such as French and Portuguese. External groups are able to contribute to these translations and translate it into additional languages through our public translation project on Transifex.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.dhis2.org/",

To the extent that the University of Oslo is involved in implementation of the software in-country -- either directly or via our HISP network -- we strive to adhere to best practices for data security and privacy, in accordance with local laws. DHIS2 features configurable access control levels that restrict access to specific kinds of information to particular user roles, groups, and organization units. Additionally, metadata can be defined as either public or private. The DHIS2 database itself can be encrypted.
