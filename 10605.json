        "The Ozim Platform was designed respecting the principles for digital development. \r\nDesign with the user. In order to structure and design the app we studied the informational needs of parents from different regions of Kazakhstan in two languages (Kazakh",
        " Russian). The data showed thematic preferences",
        " preferred study format and size (text",
        " video) of materials. Using the data we developed a beta version and invited an auditor with visual impairments to check the accessibility of the application for people with visual disorders. After approving the version by focus groups we launched an app in the markets: App Store",
        " Google Play.\r\nBe data driven. Our utmost goal is to provide parents of young children with reliable and scientifically based information and materials. We work with authors who are experts in the field of early intervention and early development. One of the important directions of our project is to convert scientific articles into an accessible language for parents. \r\nBe collaborative. In the beginning of the project we started to work with NGOs and the private sector in the field of early development and intervention. This collaboration led to mutually beneficial partnerships. Today we started to work with government sectors and social entrepreneurs for the widest coverage of the population and positive impact among users. "
