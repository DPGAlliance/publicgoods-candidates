So that governments can pass the benefits (financial, education and health) directly to the beneficiaries. Both the public and private sector needs (decentralised) digital identity (AKA Self-Sovereign Identity) infrastructure to effectively organize, and in fact to build the digital societies of the future by being able to issue verifiable credentials and verify those."
