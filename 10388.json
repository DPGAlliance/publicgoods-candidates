        "relevance": "We produce country scores for five economic and social rights. These are the rights to education (SDG4), food (SDG2), health (SDG3), housing (SDG6) and work and social assistance (SDG1, SDG8). These scores tell us how well countries are using their available resources to make sure their people can enjoy each of these rights to the maximum extent possible given that country's level of income. Countries with well-functioning governments and effective public sectors perform better, and countries with high levels of corruption or inequality generally perform worse (hence SDG10). Many of the SDG indicators also feed into the Rights Tracker scores. However, unlike the SDGs, our scores are benchmarked according to each country's level of resources. This avoids the income bias problem that is inherent in the SDGs. (i.e. higher income countries generally perform better on most SDG indicators).  This is very important as it has been documented (e.g. by the World Bank) that ESG investment strategies that use the SDGs (and simliar) as indicators of development, skew investment away from lower income countries towards higher income countries. Our award-winning methodology avoids this problem. \r\n\r\nUsing a different methodology, we also produce country scores for eight civil and political rights. These relate closely to SDG16 and provide additional metrics not already captured by the SDG16 targets."
