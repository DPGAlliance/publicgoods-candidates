The platform has been primarily designed to address target 3.4 (By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being).  \r\n\r\nMedtronic LABS mission is to expand access to healthcare for underserved patients, families, and communities around the world. Through our open-source technology platform and recipe for health systems strengthening, we provide sustainable and localized healthcare solutions that deliver measurable patient outcomes. More information about Medtronic LABS can be found at https://www.medtroniclabs.org.  \r\n\r\nSPICE is the first open-source digital platform designed to support a new era of data-driven community healthcare delivery. We go beyond the commonly used data collection tools to ensure that all community-based activities are bi-directionally linked to the health system. Our technology is embedded directly within health systems and government digital ecosystems to transform the way healthcare is delivered. With SPICE, service delivery is driven by data for smarter resource allocation and better health outcomes. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the SPICE platform supports SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities) and SDG 17 (partnership for the goals) based on our approach to partnerships and health system strengthening and sustainability within each of our programs.
