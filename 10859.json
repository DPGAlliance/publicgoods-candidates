Children would read books aloud, get their speech transcribed, and obtain real-time feedback on their pronunciation. This is one core component of the development of our larger solution, Bookbot, which aims to teach literacy to Indonesian children in a fun, engaging, and self-learning fashion. One of our goals is to provide equal quality education, specifically on literacy, to all Indonesian children regardless of where and who they are -- all in a mobile app that runs offline and in real-time."
