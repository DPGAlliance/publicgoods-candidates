The metadata standards, data methodology, and analytics are transparently shared on the platform for consumption and feedback by stakeholders in agriculture. Given the non-PI nature of data used and generated by the platform, coupled with transparency & accountability mechanisms built into the design, the risk of harm is reduced significantly. \r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/undpindia/dicra/blob/main/docs/dpg-criteria/criteria-9.md \r\n\r\nThe PII data, however minimal, is stored on UNDP's cloud infrastructure and secured through a multifactor authentication system.

Indigenous knowledge is tapped through field validation and ethnography to suggest good practices on climate resilient farming that are already working well through bottom-up approaches, to feed into large scale agriculture programs and policies and optimize public investments on climate resilient agriculture.  DiCRA platform therefore contributes to SDG 2 to 'End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture'. Specifically DiCRA contributes to SDG target 2.4 which states 'By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality. ,\r\n \r\nThe objective of the DiCRA platform is to provide free and open access to geospatial datasets through an open digital platform thereby enabling concrete evidence-driven policies and concerted action from all stakeholders involved in sustainable and climate resilient agriculture.

            "1. DiCRA platform requires the functionality to allow policy-makers to search for a village or locality to perform analysis on climate and agriculture indicators. This requires an API that allows for geocoding (the process of converting address in text format to geo-coordinates). We explored the use of (open option) OSM Geocoder - Nominatim for this but found that the spatial accuracy and match rate is low for our preliminary area of interest which was Telangana. Hence we have used Google Geocoding API for this use case. In case the developer wishes to deploy the application without using this API",
            " the codebase includes the following module which uses Nominatim instead of Google API. \r\n 2. Based on our visual identity and user experience discussions",
            " we have used the CARTO base map public styles (not the proprietary style)as the base map for our map views. It provides a BSD 3-Clause License for the code and CC-BY 4.0 for the design. But it does have the following limitations: \r\n -- free usage for up to 75",
            "000 map views per month \r\n-- none-commercial services only. \r\nThis service does not need to enable an API or an account to set up the base map. If the dark theme is not required",
            " the developer can use alternatives quite easily by updating the code base use services such as Open Map Tiles. \r\n 3. DiCRA also includes a Satellite View which uses the Google Basemap which requires an account registration as well as setting up of API. But the codebase also includes an option to reconfigure it to use USGS or ESRI Base maps instead of Google service."
