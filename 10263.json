More on the goals, the way we work and participating institutions can be read on: https://consulfoundation.org/about and https://consulproject.org/\r\n\r\nMoreover, we support governments to work on all Sustainable Development Goals with their citizens. We have joined forces with The United Nations Development Programme and the cooperative Enreda to foster participation around the Agenda 2030 by incorporating a SDG module into the software, so that entities around the world can use it in their Sustainable Development Goals localization processes.
