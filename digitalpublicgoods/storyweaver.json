We have a quality control framework for onboarding volunteer reviewers to review user-generated content, which allows for the rating of the books on a number of parameters. This process not only helps us identify and pull down malicious and/or harmful content, but also helps us identify good writers and translators, and recommend high-quality content to our users. Additionally, users can directly report malicious and/or harmful content to moderators on the platform. The tools for the same are user facing on the platform at a story level. The reported content is screened by moderators and if found malicious and/or harmful, it is pulled down from the platform.  The user-author or user-illustrator ( whose work is pulled down) is notified of the same via email from StoryWeaver. The notification mailer details the specific reason for pulling down such content.  Users have a chance to modify the content and re-upload their work Users repeatedly posting such content are banned from the platform - they can read but they are not allowed to create / upload anything.   We do not allow the hosting of content as per the following guidelines:  Content that is considered using copyrighted ideas/images, characters or intellectual property that belong to another person or entity, content that contains explicit or provocative content or that depicts overly-detailed or mature portrayals of violence (to people or animals), or use of language (e.g. profanities), physical/romantic relationships, self-harm, or substance abuse.  Content that promotes hate speech, discrimination, or intolerance based on language, religion, or region.  Content that pushed personal agendas, or specific moral or religious belief systems.  Content designed to bully, marginalize, harass, insult, or attack specific users or groups"
