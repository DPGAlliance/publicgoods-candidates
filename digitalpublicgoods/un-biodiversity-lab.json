      "UNBL is built on 100% open data standards. All Science Data Sets (SDS) are spatially and temporally indexed using the STAC catalog specifications, allowing easy discovery and access to exactly the right AOI and time ranges desired. SDS are stored in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs to provide easy access to small areas (AOIs) within the very large GeoTIFF files, eliminating the need to have the entire dataset local to access and perform calculations on and create client-side visualization of using open tiling solutions (e.g. titiler). All analysis of the SDS is done using open standard analysis libraries including gdal, numpy, and xarray.",

For example, you'll find several issues opened and pull requests submitted for pgstac from Impact Observatory members.",
