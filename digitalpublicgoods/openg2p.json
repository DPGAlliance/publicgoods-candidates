    "nonPIIAccessMechanism": "OpenG2P use depends on how government agencies store, share, and treat PII data. OpenG2P advocates for and brings an approach that confers additional privacy, security and consent in systems that have historically lacked such features. The importance of this topic is highlighted in our first White Paper on the subject of Privacy and Security Design(attached).  In terms of extracting non-personally identifiable data, the building blocks are designed to export data only relevant for a specific purpose.  For example we provide an CSV export functionality as part of the data views, with field level controls available to hide specific details. \n In the context of OpenG2P, we consider 'stateless building blocks' as ones not storing beneficiary associated data beyond the life of a request-response cycle. Such components tend to be adapters with external systems. An example of a stateless brick is the OpenG2P Verification Engine which enables lookup against external identity and data sources and does not store data beyond the request-response cycle. \n An OpenG2P user will evaluate its data requirement and assess how critical it is to store beneficiary PII.  Preference is not storing data and in making solutions stateless, however, if not a viable approach we advocate the following approaches, that prioritizes storing PII at a central location rather than having them fragmented across several projects. In theory, this reduces attack vectors: \n a. Having projects store data to a central location, e.g. an existing database, and retrieving data needed to complete a request on-demand from that central locations. \n b. Saving tokens and references to the beneficiary records stored at a central location with business data, rather than the entire PII of the beneficiary. Additionally, we advise that such a token should be project-specific, reducing its viability as a correlation handle. \n c. If none of the above approaches can be taken, e.g as in the case of the OpenG2P search service which needs to maintain indexes, care, and data security measures should be instituted to protect against data breaches. \n OpenG2P creates a framework for components to work together.  The systems required by governments to register, verify, enumerate beneficiaries, send funds, verify funds received, and so on are often lacking in one or more areas and OpenG2P provides a framework for bounded components to share necessary information via secure tokens. Protecting privacy and securing data are key themes in the design of OpenG2P."
