The major difference from centralized system architectures is that peers,  collaborating in a network, can continue using their own systems and technology stack without  the need to integrate them in the classical way. Instead, blockchain provides a shared data  layer that allows these systems to interoperate on top and acts as the single truth. \n\nAs a result, the network has no single authority, which owns the data or controls the systems.  The decentralization of the ledger means a decentralization of power.\n\nLink to Evidence: https://gitlab.com/statwig-public/theledger/-/blob/development/docs/VaccineLedger_-_Data_Confidentiality.pdf"
