    "pltIndependenceDesc": "PRISM was originally developed with Mapbox GL JS version 1.x which is fully open source. Mapbox announced that version 2.x would no longer fall under an open source license. PRISM continues to utilize Mapbox 1.x. MapLibre GL is an open source alterative to Mapbox GL JS. Users of the PRISM system may replace Mapbox with MapLibre. WFP is investigating the details of this transition and plans to have the master branch on GitHub shift to MapLibre at a future date TBD."

The system can generate standard climate risk monitoring indicators as well as risk and impact analytical products, which are adapted for each hazard and the populations at risk to them. \nThe indicators on hazards – including droughts and floods – can be monitored over time through intuitive and interactive maps. Charts and related tables help to quantify the extent of a hazard by administrative area (such as provinces and districts). In addition, the system can automatically produce risk and impact indicators based on the known vulnerabilities and exposure to hazards at any point in time. All of this information can be exported from the system for further analysis and reporting. \nPRISM integrates with mobile data collection platforms – including open source solutions such as ODK and Kobo Toolbox. This allows users to visualize data collected from impacted areas in real-time, alongside the hazard information automatically generated by the platform."
