Fedora does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites. Fedora does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13. \n In the event that Fedora ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Fedora will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law. \n Reference: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:PrivacyPolicy"
