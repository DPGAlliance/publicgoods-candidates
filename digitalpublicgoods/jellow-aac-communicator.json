    "pltIndependenceDesc": "Jellow AAC Communicator uses a Google TTS engine, a closed source component due to the superior and satisfactory performance it offers especially with the Indian language and voices. One of the open source TTS engines available for the Indian language is Hear2read (https://hear2read.org/) which we've tried recently. \n The core app function is to provide speech therapy, and speech training to children with disabilities using intuitive icons. There are also a few secondary services (especially Google dependencies) that maybe inside the app or used for internal developer analysis . None of these services are part of the core app features. The secondary services include: \n- Analytics: This dependency collects user non-PII app usages such as mostly used screen and most used category icons. These analytics data are not mandatory to the app's core function. \n- Database: The Firebase real-time DB service stores the non-PII user's first language selection, registration date, app version code, user feedback, and screen usage time only. These data points are again not mandatory to the app's core function. \n-Auth: To make the above-mentioned data write protect the auth service is incorporated. If the database part is not considered mandatory then this auth service is eliminated automatically. \n-Notification: The notification service to date is only configured to notify users about new version availability. This too does not relate to the core function of the app. \n- Storage: The storage service stores language content for the app. This language content can be moved to other storage spaces like Github or another storage hosting with little changes."
