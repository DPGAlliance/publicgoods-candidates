Our course is designed to recognise this and create spaces of psychological safety where change is possible.To this end we build small 'home' teams called Buddy Groups, where a PD (personal development) mentor and a technical mentor work with 2-3 trainees over a period of 3-9 months. \nTech Buddy role https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/tech-education/education-roles/education-buddy \nPD Buddy role https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/personal-development/mentor-guide \nMore governance details connected to harm reduction: \n 1. We are all, volunteers, staff, and trainees, bound by our Code of Conduct https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/  \n2. We have a named Safeguarding lead. Staff We now also require buddies to undergo Safeguarding training. All volunteers must sign our volunteer agreement before accessing our Slack workspace. As a registered charity in the UK we are regulated by the Charity Commission and our governance is here https://codeyourfuture.io/governance/ \n3. We also contract a learning coach to work 1:1 with trainees with significant challenges, which as we are all engineers are mainly autism and ADHD."
