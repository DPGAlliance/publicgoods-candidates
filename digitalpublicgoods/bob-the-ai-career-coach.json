      "- Responsive: Thought and built for all devices, whatever the screen size and user interaction (touch, click) - Design with/for the User: User research is a key part of the design process, and user testing is done on a regular basis for improvement - Basic Design criteria Button sizes, color constrast, ... - Data-driven: Continuous improvement based on analytics, impact metrics driving evolution - Collaborative: Bayes Impact organization strives to share its insight, strategies and resources, notably on citizen-led public service, with the whole data-for-good community. These key insight are mostly gained from working on Bob product. - Design for scale: Bob is made for easily being exported to different regions or countries, using both an internationalization of its content, and a possibility of importing data from extraneous sources. It has already been deployed with local specificities in France, the UK and the USA. - Privacy & Security: Bob is designed and developed in a privacy-by-design state of mind. Its sole beneficaries are users, and their data is not communicated to any third parties outside the scope of continuous improvement"
