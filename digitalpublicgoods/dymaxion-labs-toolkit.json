      "The Dymaxion Toolkit supports reading and exporting geographic data using open, non-proprietary, platform-independent and standards-based formats, including the GeoPackage Encoding Standard (https://www.geopackage.org) and GeoJSON (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946). It is also designed and tuned to harness no-cost, open access, worldwide coverage satellite imagery from Earth observation programmes such as NASA’s Landsat (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-there-any-restrictions-use-or-redistribution-landsat-data) and European Space Agency’s Copernicus/Sentinel (https://open.esa.int/copernicus-sentinel-satellite-data/).  Dymaxion Lab’s official blog at https://dymaxionlabs-eng.medium.com/ lists step-by-step tutorial that showcase the toolkit’s integration with open data and standards.  The next section of this form (“Standards support evidence”) provides a link to a tutorial for automatically identifying large wildfires, by processing openly licenced Sentinel satellite data, taking user defined areas of interest encoded with the open and interoperable GeoJSON format."

The Code states enforcement guidelines, determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of its standards. These range from private, written warnings for first time lesser offenses, to permanent bans for sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression."
