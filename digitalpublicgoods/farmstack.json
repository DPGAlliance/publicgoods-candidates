      "Because it is used in different jurisdictions, for example the US, India, Ethiopia and Kenya, it is necessary to set standards based on the geography. In India, the software provides the consent manager containerised application (under development) which can be configured for each project as per the need. This is built using open techno-legal standard Data empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA). The software also complies with the draft personal data protection bill, 2018. The software complies with GDPR wherever applicable for data exchange, most importantly it provides a means to enforce purpose limitation, time limitation and to an extent storage limitation (on consumer side). The software also complies with ECOWAS."
