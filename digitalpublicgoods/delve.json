The platform's development involved user testing with target stakeholders following a eight month 'roadshow' that tested the concept and value proposition of the platform among sector professionals (target users). The roadshow also identified complementary initiatives and content that could be incorporated into the platform to avoid redundancies and duplication. The platform piloted a beta version of the platform in 2018 and released a full version 1.0 of the platform 2019. The platform's development relies on site analytics and user surveys and interviews to inform priorities and future development."
