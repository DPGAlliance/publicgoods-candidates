By using the JSON:API standard consumers of the API can use a pre-built client which avoids the need for us to provide helper libraries for various programming languages. In addition it serves as a set of conventions for us to follow, eliminating the need for us to make some decisions on how to design the API.",
      "Reuse and Improve - Somleng contains a compatible open source implementation of Twilio's REST API. This API has become the the de-facto standard for Cloud Communications. By being compatible with this API, users of Twilio an easily migrate to Somleng by just updating the endpoint URL in the open source libraries. Somleng also contains an open source TwiML parser. TwiML is the de-facto markup language for controlling calls and SMS. By providing an open source TwiML parser the community can suggest or contribute support for more features and Verbs."
