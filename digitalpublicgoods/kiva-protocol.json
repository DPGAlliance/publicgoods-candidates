      "As described previously, Kiva Protocol follows 'privacy by design' principles, including data minimization, non-correlation, and user control/ selective disclosure. And of course, no PII is ever written to the ledger. However, for any given implementation it remains up to our government partners to define their own governance policies and determine their compliance with all relevant laws.  Therefore all terms of service, privacy policies, etc. are defined on a project basis. \nInter-agency data sharing between the National Civil Registration Authority and the Bank of Sierra Leone is permitted under the National Civil Registration Authority Act.  Additional regulations governing the use of the eKYC platform to facilitate new account onboarding and customer due diligence are being developed by the Bank of Sierra Leone. A broader initiative to develop a consumer protection regime in Sierra Leone - which may include privacy and consumer financial protection - is being conducted by UNCDF with support from Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)."

      "Kiva Protocol has been awarded the ID2020 Certification Mark, and won the World Bank ID4D’s Mission Billion Challenge Global Prize. Its design and operational model embodies best practices around privacy, agency, and open and standards-based technologies, and specifically adheres to the ID4D Principles of Identification.  Though it isn’t formally measured, the community also actively seeks to support Privacy by Design and principles of data minimization and non-correlation so that users can have confidence sharing data between issuers. The Core Infrastructure Initiative badge is a part of certifying the components of the system that are part of Hyperledger and project results can be found here https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/4088."

        "Kiva Protocol currently allows individual data subjects to: \n1) share identity credentials with a financial institution or government agency, \n 2) share credit history or other financial transaction records with a financial institution or government agency, \n 3) share data with other individuals in a peer-to-peer manner.

It also stores financial transaction data provided to individual data subjects by their financial service providers. Holding these data in Kiva Protocol’s cloud-based digital wallet infrastructure typically provides higher levels of privacy and security than the on-prem or hybrid databases maintained by identity agencies in Kiva partner jurisdictions. Each data subject wallet is encrypted with its own key. A defense in depth approach is used throughout the architecture to ensure that no one failure can compromise the entire system. This includes, but is not limited to, a Web Application Firewall, separation of duties, regular dependency patching, and security monitoring. In addition, we run regular security audits to find and address vulnerabilities in our configuration, software and architecture. The last audit used ioActive."
