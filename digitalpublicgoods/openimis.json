However, since 2017 a complete rearchitecture of the system is in process, which includes the development of the software using a modular architecture, and also using open source programming languages and databases. The new modules are developed to run side-by-side to the older versions (MS based) until the full transition in complete - after which there will be no further dependencies."

This data is not shared with any third parties and the data is collected using third party platforms (Atlassian for our collaboration platform and Mailchimp for the newsletter), and they are governed by the GDPR.",
        "The openIMIS product does have the functionality to collect various data of users, including names, date of birth, ID number, phone number and also a (limited) medical treatment history. However the product is not hosted by the initiative, and thus anyone wanting to implement it would need to ensure that the data protection regulations of the area of jurisdiction are met. For example, the Health Insurance Board of Nepal uses openIMIS to manage the National Health Insurance of the country – so they deploy openIMIS as their own system and ensure that data confidentiality and data privacy regulations from the Government of Nepal are met. That being said, openIMIS does offer various levels of data security functionality for the implementers of the tool to use – particularly centered around role based access (read only, write only, none, or both) to data within the openIMIS system. Additionally, the openIMIS initiative provides security guidance on deploying openIMIS: Infrastructure security - openIMIS - openIMIS Wiki (atlassian.net), and also a template to do security assessments of implementations: Security assessment template - openIMIS - openIMIS Wiki (atlassian.net)"
