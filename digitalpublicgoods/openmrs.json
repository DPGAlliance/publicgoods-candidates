In situations where someone witnesses behaviors in the community that betrays our code of conduct, we encourage individuals to communicate concerns directly with that individual or group. In circumstances where someone is either uncomfortable approaching the individual or group, or feel as if their intervention has been unsuccessful, individuals are encouraged to approach the OpenMRS community management team."
