You can join the class, copy the content, edit it and then share it to your own class syllabus.

      "additionalInfoMechanismProcessesPolicies": "Equity of Access Risk: high data costs restrict access to the notesmaster platform and in particular the video lessons for poorer learners. Mitigation: Notesmaster operates as a zero-rated platform in Malawi giving free access to all stakeholders, which makes the digital lessons programs under way in partnership with the MOE Malawi as part of their World Bank funded EQUALS project, open to all stakeholders. The same process is being adopted in Zambia with MTN and discussions are underway in the Caribbean. To enable this approach, content is hosted locally and not always with AWS Virginia or Oregon. \n Risk: Accuracy of content and adherence to local best practice in authoring digital lessons. Mitigation: Our project works closely with Ministries of Education in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific to identify challenges in covering their local curriculum accurately and in keeping it up to date The project  identifies a mixture of highly skilled and lo skilled teachers and trains them in how to use the platform and sponsored software such as H5P, Pixton, Wordwall and Vyond to create interactive lessons. A train the trainer approach is adopted to ensure skills can be cascaded down to the classrooms by program participants and workshop attendees. Risk: Sustainability of the content and adaptability to updated curricula. Mitigation: As demonstrated in the video above, the Notesmaster platform has developed an online peer review system that allows all stakeholders to contribute to a sustainable multiplier effect, leading to growing number of digital resources. These digital lessons can be copied and reversioned, then submitted for peer review by the local community. \n Risk: Impersonation of Teachers by students. Mitigation: The platform is designed in such away that persons impersonating teachers can do little harm. They are not able to achieve a position of influence over their peers through impersonation. The respective Ministries of Education have a roster of curriculum officers who regularly access the platform and respond to challenges or flag unruly language or behaviour. They are supported by the Notesmaster support team whose task is to ensure the smooth running of the platform."
