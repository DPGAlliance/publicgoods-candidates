Exporting is possible in all these formats too."

Users can be kept anonymous, data collections can be designed either to not collect any PII, or  to ask for consent for each data collection. In terms of security, it supports having data securely saved, transfer of data over secure connections, passwords stored in hashed format. A lot of these features are inherited from the Django development framework on which Iaso is built."

      "We can account with the following principles for digital development: \nDesign with User - Our software is designed in perpetual feedback loop with users, where most features tend to be mocked up and shown to end users before being implemented to allow to spot hard to understand concept, security and access issues and such. \nUnderstand the Existing Ecosystem - Iaso integrates with the existing ecosystem. In particular, it allows to reuse forms in the common xlsform format and to import and export data to DHIS2, which is probably the most installed health information management system. In terms of data collection, Iaso differentiate itself from other data collection tools by being offline-first, ensuring that data collection can happen even when no internet connectivity is available. \nDesign for Scale - Performance is at the center of our work as, for cost effectiveness,  we try to host multiple customers on the same servers, while still providing a quality experience to each customer individually. This leads us to constantly monitor performance. Outside of the performance issue, Iaso is also designed to split the work of various teams in sub teams, or to limit access by geographical scope, which allows sometimes thousands of people to collaborate on the same data collection effort without conflicting results. \n Build for Sustainability - We rely on open source software components and are building a solution that organizations can install and manage locally.  \nReuse and Improve - We have reused lots of various products, and amongst them, the ODK project, which is a digital public good"
