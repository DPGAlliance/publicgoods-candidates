DHIS2 is also used by national health authorities and international health programs and organizations (such as WHO, the CDC, PEPFAR, The Global Fund, Gavi) for management of health programs related to specific diseases, such as HIV, TB, Malaria, and others. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 60 countries rapidly deployed DHIS2 for national pandemic response and/or vaccination programs.\r\n  \r\nDHIS2 has also developed a module for last-mile logistics intended for use at health facility level and integrated with a central eLMIS or ERP. The features include report and transaction based stock management, equipment management and temperature monitoring. In addition to health, DHIS2 is also now being deployed as an Education Management Information System (EMIS) in several countries, which facilitates more effective triangulation of data between health and education programs (for example, vaccination campaigns targeting school-aged children), as well as supporting purely education-related goals.

It also covers extended technical topics related to DHIS2 systems such as server configuration and custom application development, and includes a capacity building section that provides adaptable guides for conducting DHIS2 training courses. Additionally, thorough documentation is provided on the DHIS2 Health Toolkits, which are produced in collaboration with the WHO to support the use of DHIS2 in priority health areas, including design guides that include documentation of data sets and indicators.\r\n\r\nThe DHIS2 documentation is maintained by the core DHIS2 team at the HISP Centre, but external members of the community can submit edits and updates to the documentation via GitHub. The HISP Centre supports translation of the documentation into priority languages such as French and Portuguese. External groups are able to contribute to these translations and translate it into additional languages through our public translation project on Transifex.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.dhis2.org/",

To the extent that the University of Oslo is involved in implementation of the software in-country -- either directly or via our HISP network -- we strive to adhere to best practices for data security and privacy, in accordance with local laws. DHIS2 features configurable access control levels that restrict access to specific kinds of information to particular user roles, groups, and organization units. Additionally, metadata can be defined as either public or private. The DHIS2 database itself can be encrypted.
