  "description": "An open source software to rapidly build and deploy next generation electronic registries and verifiable credentials including attestation and verification flows. Electronic registres are trusted systems that enables consented actors (who are in the registry) to enroll and avail 3rd party services built on top of it using registry APIs. Sunbird RC can be used to build various registries of people, things, entries for across domains (hospital registry, teacher registry, vehicle registry, credential registry, etc) at country scale.   Adopters can rapidly build core electronic registries through configurable schemas and workflows. Software automatically created necessary APIs, workflows, and a default UX for all key stakeholders of the registry. In addition, adopters can use Sunbird RC to implement digital credentialing based on W3C Verifiable Credential specifications.",

      "evidenceText": "Sunbird RC is an open-source (MIT license), configurable, extendable, modular software to rapidly build and deploy next generation electronic registries and verifiable credentials including attestation and verification flows.  \"Registries\" are fundamental building blocks that enable a single source of truth in various societal contexts. This is critical to activate and govern an ecosystem and enable trust among all participants of that ecosystem. People registries for entitlements, donor registries in health, establishment registries such as hospitals, schools, etc, company registry, device registries, vehicle registries, credential registries for digital locker like solutions, plat/animal registries; farmer, FPO, and agricultural registries; family registries; MSME & micro-entrepreneur registries for access to credit; registry of gig-economy workers (blue-collar workers, drivers, delivery agents, etc) for transferable verifiable work history; student registry for holistic progress card and interoperable learning credentials; school and teacher registry with quality indicators, etc are examples from the real world. Idea of decentralized registries, attestations for higher trust, issuance of credentials, etc are truly fundamental building blocks for any digital transformation project.  All digital platforms require master data and actor (person/entity/thing) data related to that system to be maintained for identification, validation, etc. As the world becomes data rich, it is essential that various data about people, entities, geographies, resources, assets, etc. are made available in electronic registries with Open APIs for other applications to seamlessly validate and use attested and authenticated data. This is even more critical when it comes to people and entities where various claims can be electronically validated against such registries via open APIs avoiding paper based validations, thus increasing trust while decreasing cost of validation.  An interoperable and unified registry infrastructure needs to be built to enable \"live\", \"reusable\", “linked”, and “trustworthy” registries are key to any large scale societal transformation.  Sunbird RC, as a generalized building block, is used to create The Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC) solution to support countries with their vaccination effort. DIVOC builds on top of  Sunbird RC to digitize the generation of a vaccination certificate available both in electronic form and printable copy downloaded from the central vaccination database. Governments across the world (India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc) have used DIVOC (built using Sunbird RC) to roll-out digital vaccination platforms.  In addition, Sunbird RC is also used in the digital infrastructure for India’s education."
