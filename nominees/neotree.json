Our work will also contribute to other outcomes for SDG3: to achieve universal health coverage, improve recruitment, development, retention and training of the healthcare workforce. Our focus on optimising newborn and child outcomes, including disability, addresses the SDGs that focus on disability: 4,8,10,11,17."
