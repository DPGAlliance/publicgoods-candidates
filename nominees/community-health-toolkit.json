The About Us page for Medic, the non-profit technical steward of the CHT, states a vision and mission that are similarly focused on SDG 3: 'We envision a more just world in which health workers are supported as they provide care for their communities, where universal health coverage is a reality, and health is a secured human right – for everyone, everywhere, always.'",

      "evidenceText": "Medic and the CHT community’s advocacy for gender equality (SDG 5) is most apparent in our advocacy for better compensation, protective equipment, and support for the mostly-female community health workers who are the main users of CHT apps. Examples include a journal article in the BMJ calling for greater involvement of and protection of CHWs in COVID-19 response, and participation in a report (lead author: Resolve to Save Lives) focused on protecting health workers.",

      "evidenceText": "In a recent blog post we shared a milestone - that CHT applications have supported over 50 million caring activities since 2014. \nWith respect to SDG 17, it bears mentioning that the CHT is widely recognized as a digital global public good, and the public goods approach is all about partnering to achieve the SDGs rather than going alone with a private/proprietary solution. Examples of the CHT being recognized as a global public good are inclusion in Digital Square’s Global Goods Guidebook, and a video featuring the CHT as a global good in a WHO and ITU supported course in Digital Health: Planning National Systems.",
