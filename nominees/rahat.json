      "evidenceText": "Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Rahat has been using its decentralized platform to distribute food supplies to vulnerable communities with small children, single women, elderly citizens in an effective and efficient manner. One of its first projects involved assisting Dhana Yoga Foundation, a US based NGO, to provide food packets to the marginalized community in Chitwan who could only harvest enough for six months. It thus aims to achieve Target 2.1 i.e. to end hunger and provide access to nutritious food all year around. In addition, Rahat has been working with local partners on pilots to support women in maternity by providing nutritious food packages in the remote mountainous regions of Humla and Jumla (on-going) with the overall aim of reducing child mortality and supporting child development (Target 2.2).",
