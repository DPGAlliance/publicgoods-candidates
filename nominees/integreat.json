Above all, local offers and information – if they are written down centrally at all – are usually not available in several languages due to the high maintenance costs. The language barrier thus adds to the difficulty.  Thus, many people are limited in their independence, and important information reaches the target group too late in the integration process.  The result: migrant target groups are restricted in their social participation and the integration process threatens to fail even because of the basic supply of information.",
