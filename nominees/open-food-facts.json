This data is used by consumers to make better informed choices, by food manufacturers to improve the quality of their products, and by scientists to research the long term links between food and health. In particular, Open Food Facts is collaborating closely with the scientific team that created the Nutri-Score and has been a major force for its adoption in France and in Europe.",
