  "description": "The ADA project builds a fully auditable digital infrastructure that enables sustainable use, reuse and exchange of personal data to enable advanced digitalisation enforced via the use of Data Agreements. A Data Agreement records the conditions for an organisation to process and exchange personal data in accordance with privacy regulation (e.g. GDPR) captured in a signed receipt given to the individual. The solution uses decentralised identity to enables data exchange using Self-Sovereign Identity, OpenID and OAuth technologies. ",
