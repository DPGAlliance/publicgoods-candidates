Still, camera traps can't yet automatically label the species they observe. It takes the valuable time of experts, or thousands of citizen scientists, to label this data. Zamba uses state-of-the-art computer vision and artificial intelligence to perform intensive camera trap video processing work, freeing up more time for humans to focus on interpreting the content and using the results.",
