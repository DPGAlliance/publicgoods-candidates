      "evidenceText": "From our experience lending with partners across 94 countries, we know verifiable identity is an atomic unit for scaling access to the formal financial sector. This poses distinct challenges for women gaining greater financial access. Women are less likely to have ID documents and often face cultural constraints in how they use them.  Kiva Protocol offers an alternative approach to digital identity management that can provide real benefits to women.  An open-source authentication platform, Kiva Protocol enables individuals to store a version of their identity documents in a digital wallet that they control, providing them with a highly secure and portable digital record. The individual doesn’t have to rely on a physical credential, increasing agency and privacy over how and when to share her information. "
