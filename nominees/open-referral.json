Instead, many organizations collect and structure community resource directory data in different ways — yielding redundant, fragmented silos.  As a result, it’s hard to ‘see’ the safety net. Many people never discover services that could help improve their lives. Service providers spend precious time verifying data rather than helping people. And without access to this information, decision-makers struggle to evaluate community health and program effectiveness. This yields underperforming systems that fail people and communities in tragic ways."
