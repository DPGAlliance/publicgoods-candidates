The sector itself employs an estimated 44+ million individuals around the world in over 70 countries (https://delvedatabase.org/data) making significant contributions to global mineral supply chains (20% of all gold, 20% of diamonds, 25% of cobalt, 80% of sapphires: Source: https://delvedatabase.org/resources/global-trends-in-artisanal-and-small-scale-mining-asm-a-review-of-key-numbers-and-issues).

By providing an accessible online platform for data collection and knowledge sharing and encouraging collaboration and contributions from the network of practitioners, Delve aims to provide a framework and impetus necessary for monitoring progress and to help ensure that the sector is recognized for its contributions to the SDGs.
