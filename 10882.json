        "relevance": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 15 percent of the world\u2019s population, or an estimated one billion people, live with disabilities. The UN's 2018 Disability & Development Report stated that, 'Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) are at a disadvantage regarding most Sustainable Development Goals', and 'concrete action is needed to include the world's one billion PWDs, as both agents and beneficiaries of development'.\r\n\r\nBarriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in PWDs engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability.\r\n\r\nDigital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure 'no one is left behind' in our increasingly digital world. Purple HATS offers a solution that significantly contributes to the improvement of digital accessibility. The customisable, automated accessibility testing tool allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility problems to improve access to digital services for the elderly and PWDs."
