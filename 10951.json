        "relevance": "Code Your Future is a free training programme for refugees and other people excluded from education and training. Our classes are free, and our teachers are volunteers. \r\n\r\nOur free and open-source syllabus is developed and published directly on GitHub. We collaborate with other free code programmes within the MigraCode network (https://migracode.eu/) and ad-hoc in the UK, South Africa, Roma, Medellin, etc. \r\n\r\nWe do our work in public. We are committed to free, open-source education and curriculum development, and all our materials are published and shared freely. People use our syllabus alone, in a code group, within another coding programme, and within our in-person classes. \r\n\r\nCode Your Future is a learning community where total life transformation happens. We understand that transformational change must be challenging but should not be harmful. Our course recognises that change can be difficult. We create spaces of psychological safety, including online spaces, where people can feel supported during a challenging learning journey to starting careers in tech. \r\n\r\nOur work largely falls on these targets in SDG 4: - Target 4.3: Equal access to affordable technical, vocational and higher education - Target 4.4: Increase the number of people with relevant skills for financial success - Target 4.5: Eliminate all discrimination in education.\r\n\r\nOur work also supports these targets:\r\n\r\n5.5 Effective participation and access to the ICT industry and cutting-edge technology. 40% of our trainees are women, while only 12.5% of software engineers in the UK are women. \r\n\r\n8.5.1 Hourly earnings & 10.2.1 People living below 50 per cent of median income. 99% of our trainees are on a low income and 83% live in poverty. Graduates from CYF typically move from 1st or 2nd decile income group to the 8th or 9th within six months of graduation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
