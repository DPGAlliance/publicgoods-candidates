As ICE does not retain any of this data, and typically requires an encrypted connection to make calls to its service, we do not believe it exposes PHI in any way in violation of this regulation. In addition, ICE uses the absolute minimum of PHI - just date of birth and gender - which cannot be easily connected to a patient by themselves."
