The game is based on years of research and experience in the science of literacy. It incorporates key skills for literacy, including Phonological Awareness, Letter Recognition, Phonics, Vocabulary, and Sight Word Reading so kids can develop a strong foundation for reading. \r\n\r\nFeed the Monster was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of the EduApp4Syria-competition. Curious Learning then localized Feed the Monster to 50+ languages, and have subsequently built a web version of the game to meet DPG criteria.",

Targeting some of the most vulnerable learners, results reported 0.46-0.63 standard deviations increase in literacy/numeracy for 6-9 year olds, making it one of the few educational interventions that rank highly for learning impacts, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.\r\nLinks to research reports below:\r\nhttps://allchildrenreading.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Feed-the-Monster-Report-Final-Web.pdf\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1URmBqeCsuaov8PK0_0Rofu4vqBfOctjY/view?usp=share_link"
