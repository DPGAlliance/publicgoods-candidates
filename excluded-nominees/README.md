# Excluded nominees

This folder contains former nominees that have been excluded as we have updated our minimum criteria. Currently these projects would not be eligible to be nominated, but we keep a copy of their past nominations for archival reasons. Should the reason for their exclusion change in the future (like being released under a compliant license), we will easily nominate them again. 

This file lists the excluded projects, the date of exclusion and the reason for exclusion at that date; sorted in reverse chronological order first, and alphabetically second.

**⚠️ We do not accept new projects that do not meet the minimum criteria. ⚠️**
