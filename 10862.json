    "description": "Challenge\r\n\r\nEnergy services are highly interconnected with socio-economic development and human well-being. Yet, life without reliable energy is a reality for more than 675 million people globally. Effectively expanding energy access requires proper energy planning and access to transparent analytical tools and data. To help address this challenge, WRI, in collaboration with partners has developed the Energy Access Explorer (EAE), a data-driven, integrated and inclusive approach to achieving universal access to energy for equitable, socio-economic development.\r\n\r\nWhat is EAE? \r\nThe first, open-source, online and interactive geospatial platform that enables energy planners, clean energy entrepreneurs, donors, and development institutions to identify high-priority areas for energy access interventions. EAE functions also as a dynamic information system, reducing software engineering and data transaction costs for both data providers and users and facilitating data management and governance. \r\n",
