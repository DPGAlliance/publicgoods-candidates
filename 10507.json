Synthea provides open-source software and freely available synthetic open data sets formatted to international standards. These resources lower the barrier of entry for innovators across the globe to build data-centric health solutions and digital health solutions. Using Synthea, health innovators can accelerate their work safely, securely, and publicly without accessing real data. Innovators also can leverage Synthea to strengthen their health information technology knowledge and skills for future jobs, research, and/or entrepreneurship opportunities to advance health and well-being."
