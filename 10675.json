Querido Diario enables more accessible information about public acts in Brazilian cities, enhancing transparency and providing tools for citizens' oversight of authorities and public policy. By 'freeing' this public information, QD is also building the case for publishing open data by default.  \r\n  \r\nTarget - 16.7 - Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. Querido Diario allows civil society, journalists, and researchers to access critical and reliable data about cities' governments and advocate for human rights in a more informed way.     \r\n\r\nTarget - 16.10 - Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. Querido Diario helps to monitor potential human rights violations, such as surveillance technology being adopted by cities. It is also a reliable source of information that helps to fight mis- and disinformation by creating a healthier information ecosystem."
