The platform ensures that the original product manufactured by the Manufacturer reaches the end beneficiary by identifying each unit as a unique digital ID and stores this information in our database so as to avoid any duplication.\r\n \r\nVaccine Supply Chains are complex and fragmented. Our goal is to innovate the supply chains, especially the Vaccine Supply Chain to have complete visibility and transparency across the various stakeholders, thus our platform VaccineLedger ensures all stakeholders have complete visibility of all vaccines and other life sciences products at different stages, using blockchain, and also predict and prevent failures in supply chains.\r\n \r\nVaccine delivery becomes more expensive due to wastage of vaccines, nearly 50%-60% of vaccines lose their efficacy because of cold-chain failures, however,  supply chain failures account for nearly 80% of the costs of the vaccines.  VaccineLedger keeps a track of all the batches and their expiry dates in order to prevent any usage of expired or counterfeit products, thus  ensuring that the beneficiary receives certified products. And if these losses are not prevented, then it becomes even more difficult to vaccinate people quickly and efficiently. "

The major difference from centralized system architectures is that peers,  collaborating in a network, can continue using their own systems and technology stack without  the need to integrate them in the classical way. Instead, blockchain provides a shared data  layer that allows these systems to interoperate on top and acts as the single truth. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the network has no single authority, which owns the data or controls the systems.  The decentralization of the ledger means a decentralization of power.\r\n\r\nLink to Evidence: https://gitlab.com/statwig-public/theledger/-/blob/development/docs/VaccineLedger_-_Data_Confidentiality.pdf"
