This means that people or organisations who aim to propose antipoverty policy can quantify the impacts of their policy recommendations, and compare against other policies to refine their proposals to maximise their impact. PolicyEngine also allows users to see how policies would affect deep poverty, defined as having income below half of the regular poverty line in a country. The app has seen usage across the political spectrum, but PolicyEngine is nonpartisan and targets a wide user-base.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Green Party of England and Wales used PolicyEngine to estimate how their manifesto would affect poverty rates in their report entitled 'Poverty Buster: The impact of the 2019 Green Party manifesto on household incomes and equality'. Available at https://martin-farley.medium.com/poverty-buster-the-impact-of-the-2019-green-party-manifesto-on-household-incomes-and-equality-9663c39b783b.\r\n\r\nSDG5: Gender Equity\r\n\r\nPolicyEngine promotes gender equity by enabling users to analyse the gender-specific impacts of various tax and benefit policies in its open-source microsimulation models and the change in gender-specific poverty rates on the web app. By providing detailed breakdowns of policy effects on different gender groups, PolicyEngine allows policymakers, researchers, and organizations to design and advocate for policies that promote gender equality and address existing disparities. This empowers users to create more equitable policies, helping to bridge the gender gap in income and economic opportunities.\r\n\r\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth\r\n\r\nPolicyEngine supports the creation of decent work and economic growth by facilitating the analysis of policies relating to how taxation and welfare interacts with households' labour choices. Marginal tax rates and issues like 'welfare cliffs' (where an individual suddenly loses entitlement to financial support with a small increase in income) are often missing from policy analyses, but PolicyEngine enables anyone to see how marginal tax rates and welfare cliffs would be affected by different policy reforms, both at the societal level and the household level.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Centre for Policy Studies used PolicyEngine to model the impacts of a tax cut on labour income, which was taken up by the government and passed into law in 2022. Their full report is available at https://cps.org.uk/research/national-insurance-a-plan-to-blunt-the-pain/.\r\n\r\nSDG10: Reduced inequalities\r\n\r\nPolicyEngine enables reducing inequalities by providing users with tools to model and analyse the distributional effects of tax and benefit policies. Users can examine the impacts of policies on the income distribution, poverty rates, and inequality measures like the Gini coefficient or the share of income held by the top 10 and 1 percent. This enables policymakers and organisations to design and advocate for policies that reduce disparities within country populations. By providing a comprehensive, data-driven platform for policy analysis, PolicyEngine helps users create targeted policy interventions that can reduce income inequality and promote social, economic, and political inclusion for all.\r\n\r\n"
