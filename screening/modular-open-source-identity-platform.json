      "-MOSIP must follow platform based approach so that all common features are abstracted as reusable components and frameworks into a common layer",
      "-MOSIP must follow API first approach and expose the business functions as RESTful services",
      "-MOSIP must not use proprietary or commercial license frameworks. Where deemed essential, such components must be encapsulated to enable their replacement if necessary (to avoid vendor lock-in)",
      "-MOSIP must use open standards to expose it’s functionality (to avoid technology lock-in)",
      "-Each MOSIP component must be independently scalable (scale out) to meet varying load requirements",
      "-MOSIP must use commodity computing hardware & software to build the platform",
      "-Data must be encrypted in-flight and at-rest. All requests must be authenticated and authorized. Privacy of Identity Data is an absolute must in MOSIP",
      "-MOSIP must follow the following manageability principles – Auditability & monitor ability of every event in the system, testability of every feature of the platform & easy upgrade ability of the platform",
      "-MOSIP must follow the principles of Zero-Knowledge which means that the services know nothing about the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data stored.",

      "-MOSIP must support i18n capability",
      "-All modules of MOSIP should be resilient such that the solution as a whole is fault tolerant",
      "-The key sub-systems of MOSIP should be designed for extensibility. For example, if an external system has to be integrated for fingerprint data, it should be easy to do so."
