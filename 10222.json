It also provides a communication platform that allows for clarification on reported cases. There are also reminders sent to reporters for any unsubmitted reports. Data collected is transmitted via a secure HTTP channel and is therefore encrypted on transit to prevent possible interception and interference. \n    Data extracted from the system is stripped off the PII data before sharing. \nAll provisions of the DPA 2016 (and other local legal and regulatory requirements) are fully implemented. \nPrivacy Policy - https://web.pharmacyboardkenya.org/terms-and-conditions/"
