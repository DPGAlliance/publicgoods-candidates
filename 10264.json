    "description": "Iaso is a geospatial data management platform (a georegistry) developed by Bluesquare to support the continuous management of geographical information. It's a platform for data collection, georegistry, activity planning and monitoring. The tool supports data management based on master lists of generic geographical objects often called organizational units (\u201corg. units\u201d, which are for example health areas, schools, provinces, health districts, or wells).",

All data collection efforts are benefiting from password protection, and no PII is transferred from the central server to the mobile devices.
