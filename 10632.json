Collect handles multiple data types and complex validation rules, all in a multilanguage environment. It allows to generate mobile-friendly surveys (Collect Mobile) as well as web-based data collection activities.",

As of the end of 2022, of the 56 countries that submitted a REDD+ reference level to the UNFCCC, 49 countries (88 percent) used one or more Open Foris tools. With the latest submissions in 2022, 66% of reporting countries used Open Foris Collect jointly with Collect Earth in their data collection process. In addition, a total of 28 countries has used OF Collect in their National Forest Inventory (NFI) for collecting field data. \r\n\r\nOF Collect has been used in Chad for woodfuel assessment in areas surrounding refugee camps, and OF Collect Mobile has been used to gather transaction data and thus to ensure food supply in rural Bangladesh.  In addition, OF tools are used for example for socio-economic inventory in Mongolia and dairy industry survey in Kazakhstan."
