            "relevance": "Our Safe YOU solution is an innovative technical solution that aims to break down societal structural barriers in order to protect & empower women. It consists of a mobile application that provides immediate emergency help to women at risk of violence, as well as acts as a bridge between women and pre-existing services (i.e. shelters/NGOs, medical professionals, social workers) which struggle to reach their beneficiaries, due to geographical or financial constraints. Women from low socioeconomic backgrounds are often at higher risk of GBV. By providing free access to services for these and all women, we are strengthening their social and economic empowerment, which will reduce their vulnerability to GBV. Safe YOU is also a platform which allows stakeholders access to case management tools and a data analysis system designed to collect non-personally identifiable data (non-PII) and provide evidence-based policy recommendations. This helps to solve the global issue of a data gap and will lead to a long-term prevention of future cases of GBV. Therefore, our solution is intended to reach most of the targets set out by SDG 5, \u201cGender Equality\u201d (targets: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5a, 5b, 5c)."

These contacts may be anyone from user's phone's contacts list, NGOs or state authorities that are included in our Apps 'Network' section, as well as the Police, if the 'Contact Police' function is enabled by the user. Since the usage of the mobile App may itself become a problem for already vulnerable groups, we have created two advanced security layers to minimize the risk of abusers discovering the app: a Dual PIN and a camouflage icon setting. The Dual PIN acts as a safety measure, allowing users to create a real PIN to access the app and a fake PIN that displays a photo gallery. The camouflage setting hides the app icon by displaying it as an image editing app so that women can use the app without fear of reprisal. The content in Forums is generated through our organization's content creators and by the personnel of governmental and non-governmental organizations who are partnering with us and have access to the tools of content generation and management. Contributors of the Forums section are thoroughly chosen to make sure that they adhere to the general principle of \u201cDo no harm\u201d, while they create content and/or consult adolescent girls and women. Our Partner organizations are responsible to make sure that their engaged personnel acts appropriately, e.g.: - Avoids questions, attitudes, or comments that are judgmental or insensitive to cultural values or status; - Does not use language, make suggestions, provide misleading information or offer advice, which is inappropriate, offensive, or abusive. In the Forums, users engage with each other in discussions and can ask questions to our partner organizations or to verified consultants, who are identifiable in the forums by a \u201cverified badge\u201d. That is why we clearly define in our \"Terms and Conditions\" and relevant policies that the users should refrain from abusing, threatening or otherwise violating the rights of others they are not allowed to publish, post, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate, threatening, infringing, obscene or unlawful topic, material, or information. To adhere to the principle of \u201cDo no harm\u201d we have moderation access in our \u201cForums\u201d section, which permits our partner organizations to moderate and remove content (user comments) that violates our terms, in some cases (when the users continue acting the same way after two notifications) the moderators have the right to block the users, who create content violating our terms. For now, the moderation in the platform is done manually by moderating the content daily. We are also currently working on functionality so that the users and contributors can report the abusive comments from mobile App and management dashboard, respectively. The Terms and Conditions as well as our Privacy Policies clearly describe these circumstances, and the users give consent to such data sharing. We ensure the security of collected data both by technical and policy means, more specifically the number of personnel, who has access to such data is strictly limited, moreover all the personnel has signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which clearly define user\u2019s personal data as a confidential information subject to confidentiality terms, the NDAs also imply strict monetary penalties in case of breach. As to the technical level of ensuring security of the data, we use SSL certificates, database connection is private -> connection to the DB is available only via local server (outbound connections are disabled).\r\n"

If an inappropriate content is detected, the author of the content is warned that the comment does not correspond to our ground rules, and it should be removed by moderator. The users and contributors themselves have the option to report any content to the moderator through e-mail to report the abusive content. The response time usually varies from 24-48 hours.

These terms mostly concentrate on minimal requirements for content providers and consultants as well as emphasize the importance of human centric, gender-sensitive and child protection norms. The users can access the content in \u201cForums\u201d section of the mobile app, if the content has age restrictions it should be clearly mentioned both in the subject of the Forum and in its banner photo- we have also developed possibility to segregate the content for minors and adults from the content management web dashboard. Users under 18 cannot access the content that was marked as 18+ from the content creation dashboard. The users and contributors have the feature to give feedback on the content by rating and providing their opinion on the content, they can also always contact the project team and report the issues that they have had related to the App or the content. Our users are encouraged to hide their identity when they interact in forums with contributors and other users, this is to ensure the anonymity and safety of the users themselves.\r\n"
