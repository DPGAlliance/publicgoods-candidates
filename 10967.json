This includes the modelling of attack scenarios, the probing of possible security holes (penetration testing), the automatic scanning of systems using tools for security analysis as well as the discussion and adaption of security measures based on these insights. The audit is taking into consideration the guidelines of the German Federal Cyber Security Authority (BSI 'IT-Grundschutz') and the 'Open Web Application Security Project' (OWASP).\r\n\r\nalso see https://aam-digital.com/aam-digital-gdpr-toms/"
