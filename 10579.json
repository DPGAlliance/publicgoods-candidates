In our local experience (South Tyrol",
        " Italy) it is used by all schools in Italian language (74 schools",
        " 1900 teachers",
        " 16000 students) and by the local public administrations in order to have an office exchange format with citizens (including students/parents in public schools). Thi is the list of open formats foreseen by the Autonomous PRovincie of Bozen-Bolzano: https://data.civis.bz.it/it/formats"

        " \r\n-- GIT and GitLab for code/documentation versioning (https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss)",
        " \r\n-- Sphinx and the RST-format for the project documentation (https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss/fuss-tech-guide",

        " https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss/fuss-user-guide)\r\n-- Ansible and YAML for configuration management",

            "privacyComplianceURL": "1) The project respects the Italian Code for Digital Administration even before Articles 68 and 69 reached their current form (May 2023). \r\n- Specifically, Article 68 of the CAD requires that acquisition of open source software or reuse of existing software should always be considered before other solutions by public administrations. \r\n-- FUSS is based exclusively on FOSS software (https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss) and therefore complies with Article 68.\r\n\r\n- Article 69 of CAD requires that public administrations that own IT solutions are obliged to publish the source code in a public repository along with the documentation under an open license. In addition, the solutions are to be published on the platform of the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID). \r\n-- FUSS also fully complies with this article as all code and documentation are published under an open license at https://gitlab.fuss.bz.it/fuss . In addition, as requested, the project is published on the AgID Developers Italia platform: https://developers.italia.it/it/software/p_bz-fuss-fuss-metadata\r\n\r\n2) The FUSS operating system (server and client) maintains user data within the institution that installs it; these data (first name, last name, groups/permissions, personal folder) are accessible only to the user and the system administrator (typically the controller appointed by the owner). None of this data is transmitted outside the institution where FUSS is installed.\r\nThese are the basic foundations that FUSS adopts to comply with the principle of privacy by design in line with the minimum security measures for Italian public administrations.\r\n\r\nIt will then be up to each organization that installs FUSS to comply with the principles and adopt organizational and security procedures so that the risk on the data processed is low, verifying that the entire chain of controllers is also compliant, from the data controllers to the processors.\r\nThe data controller, its employees, and the data processors must be trained and informed about what the GDPR requires, what personal data are, what sensitive data are, what a Data Breach (or data breach) is and how to handle it, and what to do to protect personal data."
