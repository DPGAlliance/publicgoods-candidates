Additionally, our speech-to-text technology supports SDG10 by breaking barriers and ensuring inclusivity. By making vast audio archives, such as radio broadcasts, searchable, we unveil valuable hidden content, promoting cultural understanding and diversity.\r\n\r\nSDG17: Radioship aims to foster global collaborations among community radios. Our open-source speech-to-text tool facilitates audio archive searches, encouraging partnerships and knowledge sharing. By enabling community radios worldwide to use our technology, we promote SDG17's goal of strengthening partnerships for sustainable development."
