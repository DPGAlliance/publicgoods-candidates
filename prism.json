PRISM facilitates climate risk monitoring and helps to focus attention on the most vulnerable populations. This geographic targeting is used by governments and humanitarian agencies to protect people living in poverty, and to prevent those living just above the poverty line from falling below poverty due to a climate-driven disaster, contributing to target 1.5",

These events not only increase the risk of food insecurity among affected farmers, but also the broader food system. Droughts in particular can severely impact the production of key staple commodities, driving up food prices and contributing to food insecurity.",
