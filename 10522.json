    "description": "With Unicef Innovation Fund and Giga Project, our objective is to leverage the inclusion of young people to better education and more opportunities through internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nWe also apply Machine Learning techniques to build explainable models to predict connectivity at schools. To find the model(s) that will be implemented in our service we will invest in feature selection/engineering and we will also carry-on experiments with a number of possibilities ranging from classical models (Learners) as Decision Trees and SVM's to more recent ones, including Gradient Boosting Methods and Deep Learning.",

We are using information on school locations and jobs to predict connectivity and its impact on employability. The platform provides unique Brazil labor & education market information. In this project, our main goal is to build an innovative AI model to predict connectivity at the school level using jobs-related and education features with connectivity data."
