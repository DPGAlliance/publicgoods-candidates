There is an in-house data protection management system, compliance with which is constantly monitored and evaluated on a case-by-case basis and at least every six months. \r\n Security Audits: The Aam Digital case management software including its servers and other systems are subject to an extensive annual security audit. This includes the modelling of attack scenarios, the probing of possible security holes (penetration testing), the automatic scanning of systems using tools for security analysis as well as the discussion and adaption of security measures based on these insights. The audit is taking into consideration the guidelines of the German Federal Cyber Security Authority (BSI 'IT-Grundschutz') and the 'Open Web Application Security Project' (OWASP).\r\n\r\nalso see https://aam-digital.com/aam-digital-gdpr-toms/"
